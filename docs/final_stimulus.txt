final stimulus: you want to compare tuning curves for EEG alpha/beta and gamma
rotating 25 seconds, 360deg, 5 second rest (orientation)
 => clockwise and counter-clockwise
rotating 25 seconds, 360deg, 5 second rest (retinotopy)
 => clockwise and counter-clockwise
50 trials each (25 each direction) => 50 minute experiment 
mix them both together, and do 5 10 minute runs (10 trials per run) 

change the inward annulus to have a higher spatial frequency, slower rotations, and more black pixels
oh and get the eye tracker also

BOLD and gamma have the same orientation tuning...great! what does this mean exactly? try to see if the BOLD orientation
tuning is spatially specific, or if its all in the same voxels, just a stronger BOLD response (ie, more active voxels). 

alpha/beta is not orientation tuned. what does this mean? 
the retinotopic tuning is pretty simple and probably down to distance. the orientation tuning is the really interesting
thing, because it dissociates gamma and alpha/beta. also, the BOLD seems to match the gamma in this case.
