stop smoking weed - be sharper, more alert, and more productive every day
remember - you stop smoking weed when you need to be at your best - so why not stop smoking completely, and be at your best every day
for the rest of your life? 
angry and short-tempered when you don't smoke weed - be conscious of this, and control it - otherwise, it should fade after a couple 
of days.

workouts - cardio days, and weight days - start light, and make sure the headaches don't come back, then gradually build back up to
heavier sets - but make sure breathing is always correct. be conscious of your breathing during each and every set. 

make situps a more integral part of your workout - good for core and back muscles.
