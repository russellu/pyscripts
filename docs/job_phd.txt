9 keys to online networking:
get your linked in/resume perfect before you network
ask a question at the end of your networking (in the ps) 
treat them as equal
write specific, personal subject lines
focus on them not you
do your homework on them
set a measurable goal
connecting is meeting, networking is following up
add value before you ask, don't try to immediately take value. 

7 ways to add value online
1) show appreciation as a colleague
2) compliment their work
3) congratulate their career progress (promotion, hired)
4) as them for their opinion (people like to give this)
5) as them for advice
6) make a recommendation
7) make an introduction - introduce them to someone you know well

searching the jobs the right way
use less competitive terms like "small biotech boston"
"mid sized engineering firm"

don't reach out to CEO or director, reach out to someone who has the job you want
or a similar lateral job	
make people want to reciprocate
reach out to shared connection, get their info, try to arrange a question session

A/B testing - which resumes give the best results?

phd networking - phone screening - present yourself in interviews 
need a short laser-focused resume customized for every position
train other students, write papers, manage time (other soft skills you can put on resume)
get feedback on the resume
the resume is about showing what you can bring to the table than what you know technically
sometimes no technical questions are asked during the interview
if you are not a team player or do not have the right dynamics for the team you will not be hired

need: business card, cover letter (medical science liason especially)

the hardest part about networking is talking about yourself (elevator pitch should take 5 seconds)
interview questions (90 seconds) 1) how are you today? (say perfect) 2) tell me a little about yourself?
no academic job title on resume (they are not searching for this)
it costs 60k on average to hire a phd
referrals - they get comission based on if you get hired (meet more employees)

online events - eventbrite.com
at networking events: ask "what are you working on right now that excites you?"
talk to everyone like they're the ones who could get you your next job
follow up the next day or same day
the more you get people to talk about themselves the more they will like you

your elevator pitch 1) who you are? answer: research scientist/engineer, 2) i like to go hiking on the weekends
say something they can identify with, say  "i'm looking to expand my network in xyz area"
why do i care? "i want to develop treatments in x,y, or z"

networking events: excuse me may i please introduce myself while facing the speaker, then pass it back to them
"please continue"

use the ps to ask the question the ps is the most read part of the message and the 2nd most read part of the email
make your comment something specific about the person
add value in your linked in comments
talk to them about something personal and compliment them, treat them as a colleague with who you want to work
exchanging value is the currency of industry
compliment their work, career progress, post, etc"
introduce them to someone you know well- this is like finding free money in your pocket because networking is
important but nobody has time to do it
don't use the same search terms everyone else is using when looking for specific jobs ("small" or "mid-sized")
when you see the employees of the compay on linkedin, reach out to someone in a lateral or same position as you
informational interview: get information from a current employee about their job and how they got it

say "hey i'm going to be makin some calls next week, i'd like to call you and talk to you and ask you 2 quick
questions, 3 minutes"
ask do you know of any upcoming opportunities at your company, if they say yes, ask if they can pass along your 
resume to the manager
one key question "is there anybody else that might be good for me to talk to?" always leave an interview by setting
up another connection
