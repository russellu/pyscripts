ohbm_sunday: 
so far, RSN dynamic is crap, same as stationary, ie it is not non-stationary
inter-subject reproducibility across tasks and states, rsn is least reproducible 
BOLD EPI - blip phase encoding, "slow" acquisition
lack of reproducibility - reproduction by different subject group, to test predictions (80% in depression). 
shmuel - BOLD is LFP, but to what proportion do LFP and MUA contribute to different frequencies. 
global signal regression is leaning towards religious fervor 
global signal regression could be useful in simeegmri studies
better to do ICA on volumes separately (ie don't concatenate) - get gray matter mask and look at power/weight maps
	-check quality of each ICA decomposition separately.
a move away from RS FMRI back towards task FMRI  to differentiate between healthy sujects
huang empirical mode decomposition for BCG and gradient removal 
time-frequency meta analysis
auto-encoders for BOLD and EEG denoising (try EMD first though)
