mission statement: to build a passive income of 10k (net) per month over the next 5 years

step 1: get a high paying job (75k+/yr) 
step 2: find high cash flow properties in sherbrooke and surrounding area 
step 3: buy 2-3 properties per year (10-15 properties by 2024) 

assuming you can net around 125$/month per unit
10000/125 = 80 units in the next 5 years => 15 quintuplexes

right now you're at: 2100/month = 11600 net, minus any expenses
netting around 500 per month from the kingston house
which means you need around 20 more of those

buying the quintuplex on belvedere will add another 600$/month
