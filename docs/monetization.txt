5000 downloads, 130$, with a 30% monetization strategy (could be a lot better). 
if you have a good monetization strategy (get 3% of users to spend 5 bucks), then you should be making around 150$ every 1000 DL
that would mean 150k for a game with 1mil downloads.
of course, there are some apps that do waaay better than this. that monetization ratio is still quite poor. 
take admob for example. if you have 1,000,000 downloads, you can assume 300,000 installs, and maybe 60k users per day for 5 minutes 
each. assume a 1$ ecpm, and 1 ad per minute, 60*5 = 300$ per day in ad revenue = 109,000$ per year.
