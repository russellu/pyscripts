forex_price_Action_game:
make it web-based, or native android/ios? 
native android first, then port to IOS (should be simple enough). 
game features: 
currency pair (Eurusd, eurjpy, etc)
speed (ticks/sec)
timeframe (tick, 1m, 5m, etc)
time of day (specific times - 5am, etc) 
indicators (start with 3 basic ones: MACD, MMA, and bollinger bands, local min/maxima)

adding strategies? 

basic functions (free) : buy, sell, leverage, different currencies, save account, account settings, indicators
premium - more currencies and other instruments, live data feed, more indicators, expert analysis (auto-trader), more
time scales

put the UPL visualization on the left side (based on stop loss and take profit - if they don't exist, figure something out

by tonight: have a working game, where you can select leverage, timescale, and other factors such as timeslot 
randomize => close all trades, and select a new timepoint to trade from. 
ForexPriceAction
set max stop loss (in $) and trailing stop (trail stop), show #trades 

free, premium

free: buy/sell, 1 currency, 1 leverage, 1 timeframe, no indicators, all speeds, all #points 
premium: all currencies, all leverages (10,50,150,200,300,400), all time frames, all indicators, speeds, npoints
ability to select time slots (open, etc), live trading
indicators : rainbow, MACD, bollinger bands, CCI, stochastic, etc (try to get 20+ so you can advertise) 

HOW TO Do the zoom properly? 
the screen should always be full #1
when you max out the zoom, it should just go to the last data point available 

free:
- one month of data
- one currency pair
- one leverage (10x) and timeframe (1min) 

premium:
- select and trade specific time slots
- access over 20 different currency pairs
- access different indicators such as MACD, stochastic, and bollinger bands
- save and review your trades
- access all leverages (10:1,50:1,100:1 etc) and timeframes (tic, 1min, 5min, etc) 


stuff remaining to do: 
more currencies (Add button) 
more timeframes (download dukascopy data)
add trade indicators on chart
faster loading (how?) -> parse and save as a more quickly loaded file?
save as a predefined format (text file, with each line a data point, but you know the order before hand so its easy to read
ie, save each as a string with indices should be much faster to read 

next big step: popup keyboard, to customize stop/tp, and indicator parameters
a way to make it cover the screen from all the other buttons

you consistently do worse than chance. this means you can also do consistently better than chance

stuff remaining: premium, and simple
menus - currency and time selection
parsing the time-slots, and saving that information
persistence (Accounts)
indicators (customizable)
also find a way to isolate the non-farm payroll and other news events (news)

6 days deep = > more than half done - try to have it released by sometime next week (next friday as the deadline) 

a new forex strategy: buy, and wait for it to go in your favor. if it does, close (After a certain amount of time)
if it doesn't, wait for a bit, and then look for an opportune time to exit (ie a local high) - try this later 

success = handling objections

app idea: offline crawler

main menu: enter account name and balance
the button visibility controller - controls which buttons are on top and which ones are on bottom, ie, in what order they
get drawn, and which ones are active/not active (can add this later to the main game screen). 

problems: still have keys showing up when you press the menu butotn, and still having a problem with the close button
being pressed at the same time as the menu button. a timer would solve both these issues, it seems. 

set up a background behind the menu (a cool picture of the stock market) 

stuff to do - faster read-line (parse and read quickly) 
put the background image on the mainMenu screen
finish the account set up, save, and loading - and create multiple accounts 
get emulator working, and test buttons in tablet mode - re-do buttons with icons (zoom, etc) 
finish 3/4 of those by tomorrow 

by wednesday - server loading and tic data parsing

by friday - release 

next step: finish the account loading, and display the message (finish the menu tonight) - loading, and saving, even after
exiting application. clean up the top of the game screen at the same time, with the UPL and account name etc 

start the application - show the main menu.
create/load an account - show the game screen, and load the data at that time (also show a loading data screen) 
put error messages in red, and success messages in green, waiting messages in yellow. 
put a slowly moving trace behind the menu (partly translucent) 
main menu is basically done. now, time to move on to something else
what needs to be finished about the menu? finish the account loading/saving (permanence, after you exit the app)

things to display at the top: account name, currency, equity, upl, leverage

how to do the loading accounts properly?
have a name arraylist, and an account arraylist corresponding to the name arraylist
load the name arraylist first, and then in a try/catch block, load the accounts after. 

loading and back buttons on menu working
now, get the accounts working with the right currency data files, and saving the account balance properly
	add more fields (current currency file, current time point, etc) 
then work more on the display (add leverage, and improve the colors)
then do the account summary
add info to the account loading screen (account balances)
add the ability to delete accounts (when you press load, you load or delete)
find how to put icons on buttons and re-organize interface 
organize the account loading screen better (put a scrollbar, and make the size automatically a certain height) 
	something is wrong with this, it is randomly deleting accounts (fixed, was due to serialization) 
add a random noise option 
when loading account, set option to 
need to change up the buttons - set it to onACTIVATE OR SOMETHING (sTILL having issues with the back)
show number of lots active 
add button click sounds
add market sounds, add frequency specific humming to the market (Candlebars) 
add yearly ROI
add shaded account buttons
get it working with different currency pairs (fix all the constants) 
add some messages on the leverage and timeslot and currency selecting 

next : shaded account buttons, and option to delete accounts (load/delete) 
things to fix: time series running over the loading screen
fix the ending time series error 
add shaded account buttons 

make the account loading screen look a bit nicer (tighter button text, restrict the size of the buttons) 

add a heartbeat signal, and a brain signal
more debugging, use admob

the app is a lot harder to work on because it has less of a short term gain

things left: fix the back button (done)
get an emulator and test the buttons
add button labels, rearrange the buttons 
add time slot selection code 
add news events (purchase news events, and purchase different currencies) 
	=> add all time slots, and 
add an ad or in-app purchases
simpler to separate them all into their separate views? a view for the account load screen, a view for the account creation screen, a view for the main menu
and a view for the game itself then you could just call switch views when you wanted to go to a different view
the trade tracker - place a green or red bar where you buy or sell, and follow the price with the bar. if it goes outside the range, set the bar to be the max. 
then also have lines connecting the bar to the current point. 
add the random noise thing
make the icons, and rearrange the order
parse some news events, and put them in their own files

4:13 est = 8:13 utc
just find the matching string, and then take 240 points further in the dukascopy data. 

how to organize these events? pick the most impactful events, and epoch all those
nonfarms seem to be correct. can assume all the others are as well, i guess...
epoch them, then go home, and smoke 

tonight, add the epoch to the app, and practice trading some news events (See if its predictable) 
add different currencies

the trade tracker can't containt the data, because then it will always try to save it. 

today: add news epochs, and save a bunch of different news events from a bunch of different currencies
today: select 8 final currencies to use, and have 1 yr of 1min data each (20mb), and 5-10 different news events each
today: select the time slot also
today: fix the buttons on the emulator (txt size + button size) 
monday night: release app on play store 

payment model: interstitial when loading/creating account, and in-app purchases
icons almost done - need to improve the labels for the current icons (use matlab) and make new labels for the other
icons
then, get the currency flag icons
improve the news trading a bit 
have one sample currency, and one sample news release to trade
add indicators 

MAIN THINGS TO FINISH: 
1) add all currencies, and fix all constants, fix account loading/saving of variables
2) fix all problems with news trading (starts too early, not enough events, no event labels, no switching, etc)
3) finish all buttons and fix button layout/full screen mode
4) add rainbow mode and volume indicators
5) in app purchases: indicators, other currencies, and more news events 
 free = non-farm payroll, gbp jpy, and candles 


today: put all buttons, improve news display (line in middle, etc), do full screen enhancement
full screen
news enhancement (buttons + line in middle + more information) 
getting all the news events: find the top 20 events, for each currency, based on how much the market moves after 
each event, so sort each 
add scroll buttons for news
Jed Meshew
summarize account at the end of news
put back and summarize at top/side 


price resets to zero tp and stop when you switch trading modes...
put a small test currency, after selecting all the currencies you will use ... all the core game functionality
should be in place by tomorrow: (news events + account summary + time slot + multi-currency).
then on monday do the monetization shit and release it 

next step = news trading (all currencies) + menu
1) organize the currencies you will be using (same ones from the data you bought)
need to save each currency with its own parameters (news events it is sensitive to) 
currencypair(name), spread(line 2), news events (other lines), then just load the events from the click 

for the news trading - sort according to average impact, and save only the top impacting news events => will cut 
down on space and confusion, done
also, save the number of events and the event stats => ie, expected, and actual , done
change leverage so that every time you trade a news event it doesn't reset, done
borland team audit

still need to add random noise, indicators, account summary, and improvements to buttons, then you should be good
to go to monetize and release! 
rest of the effort should be spent on releasing it in different stores (get it featured in 3-5 different stores)
crashing on new markets

formulate a strategy for trading news events - that actually works, and put that in to the indicators as well 

the price is roughly correlated with the news - check all currencies, all news events 
newsepochs size is always max and always the same - why? 

need another metric - 
find a strategy that works on the news events - simple moving average? 
need an indicator that actually WORKS that you can add to the app. 
strategy: find the crossovers, and epoch around them

stop not advancing towards your goal. your goal is to put this app out by the end of the week, and then move on 
to the next app (the fourier image app) 
tomorrow: finish all the shit with the different currencies and loading accounts...saving accounts and loading 
accounts properly. this is the last step (and the leverage etc) 
remaining: time-slot epoching, and the spread calculation (also put a spread display) 
time-slot epoching, put the lines on the screen
save the indices, or put them in some kind of array, so that you don't run the same timeslot twice in a row
finish the pip value for the currency pairs. -> done
randomization of time series isn't working correctly...why

some stats for the summarize account: -> done
remaining: add the stat calculation to the tradetracker, finish the account saving/loading properly, and then
do the monetization (pay for additional currency pairs) 

problem - when you switch currencies using the randomize button, it resets the currency but doesn't reset the 
tp? or rather, just when you switch to news trading, from normal trading after switching currency
