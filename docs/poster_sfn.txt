sfn so far...
lots of oscillations...
main points on poster: can use the ff/fb ratio to explain the BOLD orientation tuning (Rather than orientation anisotropies)
other posters: 

memory perception, 
	there is overlap between memory and perception, but the memory tuning curves are much broader
	linked to FF/FB activity? 
memory model
	memory is not a discrete process but a mixture of gaussians, memory sampling is continuously degraded with time	
v1/v2 connections
	10x more feedback than feedforward
v1/v2 orientation tuning
	v2 orientation tuning looks less spatially specific
neural spheres
	you can inject stem cell sphere into the brain, or grow them with astrocytes, astrocytes release molecules that cause them to 
	develope more synapses
optogenetics ventral tegmental area
	supressing activity in the VTA reduces fear response
eeg voltage 
	use raw instantaneous voltage instead of power or phase, to correlate with perceptual effects
	can try this with FMRI as well, and EEG theta and alpha/beta
decoded memory vs function
	areas responsible for activating during memory recall are similar across memory tasks, and distinct from areas involved in decoding same tasks
optimal contrast tuning curve
	500ms, 6 points, 30 trials - you can estimate the contrast tuning curves for BOLD and EEG or just EEG based on this (you can do BOLD as well) 
super agers
	cognitively younger elders have thicker cingulate cortices
parahippocampal gyrus prf
	large, bilateral prf in parahippocampal gyrus
v6 mapping with optical flow
	v6 can be isolated by optical flow experiments
center surround orientation tuning
	90 degree phase offset for surround? 
traveling waves seen using ECOG and EEG
spectral parameterization 
	peak frequency as a function of time 
dynamic synapses
male female social behavior - can be altered by flipping a switch

possible future ideas: prf using neural network, instantaneous voltage vs FMRI, contrast tuning curve estimation, 

most important posters:
1) distribution of synaptic terminals - larger driving synapses, smaller modulatory synapses, gamma and alpha
2) bold as a function of time-lag correlation: more networked hubs = less time variance
3) microstructure - goal of 1mm fully reconstructed
4) optic radiation retinotopy - feeds v1 v2 v3
5) eeg components - classify if they are part of the brain or not based on scalp ica
6) neurovascular coupling state specific
7) pulvinar coordinates activity in v1 and v4 - theta increases in peak frequency results in +/- baseline change with narrow bar
8) modeling LFP with previous LFP 
9) spatial correlations locally reduced injection
10) implantable acoustic probes
11) calcium correlated to gamma and arterial diameters, calcium spiking variability predicts gamma and diameters
12) ecog auditory cortex high gamma independent component analysis
13) synaptic dendrites in layer 6 contact reciprocal pyramidal cells more so than soma-specific connections
14) size and spatial frequency tuning maps using intrinsic signal
15) movie vs contrast grating feedforward and feedback silencing - silencing feedback has larger effect on movie.
16) ECOG gamma in response to opacity faces higher gamma more opacity
17) modeling contrast response function inhibitory + excitatory
18) multi-grid brain probe that you can implant
19) eeg electrodes for sensing the electric field vector - 3 components signals
20) gamma with age - lower peak frequency and power, higher gamma for females
21) functional ultrasound imaging in 3d on brain with skull removed 
22) alpha peak frequency and pain
23) subdermal recordings - small incision and insert grid
24) state space oscillator for decomposing neuronal frequencies
25) gamma rhythm does not alter with perceptual recall (meaning perception does not require lower level vision?)
26) lower pca components can obtain sufficient coding accuracy (ie lower components still contain significant info)
27) kernel + neuralink - create cv, email all companies on exhibitors list, follow on linkedin
