coupling results for coupling paper
-first check the best way to get correlations - compute in sliding window, with bandpass/without bandpass filtering (not necessary
if using sliding window) - get rest in all subjects and see how it looks. 

compute different types of processing on your FMRI - global signal regressed, and non global signal regressed. (this can be a result)
state, region, and pipeline dependent neurovascular coupling: implications for FMRI analysis	

get all badger subjects FMRI in grid space, start running matlab coupling script, convert mongoose grids, run on mongoose, average all
in atlas space (rest) 

coupling results - raw, and with motion interpolation 

show a significant difference in gamma coupling due to motion correction 

get all subjects into the same space (down-sample the atlas brain?) - this should work

get the correlation map between gamma and MEH. 

3 types of processing - raw, mc, and gsr_mc - look for significant coupling differences between gsr_mc and mc, and raw and mc. 
you already know that gamma correlations are drastically reduced when correcting for motion artifacts 

the main point is to find significant differences. look first at all states and subjects - for global signal regression, to mc
voxel-based or ROI based?  ROI based - downsample ROIs, and get mean kernel in each ROI, for all processing pipelines ~
get the ROIs, and look for significant differences in the cross correlations across ROIs
	=> this allows you to look at temporal differences in specific regions

another way - look at the classic hemodynamic time lag, and average across frequency bands alpha/beta and gamma, then perform 
voxel-wise comparisons 
	=> this allows you to look at spatial differences in specific regions

look for a pattern here. examine different states and processing types. 
you can also look at overall patterns in terms of DMN/V1 positive/negative alpha/beta correlations 

so to recap: you want the following data (in both datasets, but start with badger)
1) cross-correlation kernels in all ROIs, assuming 12 ROIs, it will be a vector of [3,12,9,6,50,41] or [ROI,sub,tsk,freq,time]
	first thing - downsample ROIs
2) HRF time-lag cross-correlation kernels in all voxels, vector of [30,30,15,3,9,6,50] which can be further averaged across freq
	first thing - find optimal time lag
once you have these vectors, do t-tests across the following
1) mc vs non mc (all states, stim), mc vs gsr (all states, stim), mc&gsr state vs state vs state

2) mc vs non mc (all states, stim), mc vs gsr (all states, stim), mc&gsr state vs state vs state

state dependence - t-tests between different states. 

two main results: the coupling difference in DMN due to GSR, and the reduction in gamma coupling due to interpolation
of EEG motion (show motion spike time series, show GSR example). 
show also the global signal correlated with neural activity (And references) 
GSR introduces positive alpha-bold correlations in the DMN - what does this say about GSR? 
GSR introduces anti-correlations in noise voxels. 
without GSR, the DMN is not correlated to alpha, with GSR, the DMN becomes positively correlated. 
interpretation - GSR is removing respiratory-induced fluctuations, and 
GSR also results in lower overall correlations (check this in the data), implying it removes true neural activity
GSR also correlates significantly with EEEG 

two interpretations - GSR good, GSR bad (or GSR does nothing)
GSR good - positive alpha-BOLD correlations due to removal of respiration noise - how? 
GSR bad - positive alpha-BOLD correlations due to anti-correlations

final results - need the motion time series from each subject (go back to ICA decompositions, and find components that correlate with motion regressors, or just look
like motion according to mullinger's work. the only true way would be to compare these using cross correlation with FMRI, but mullinger ref should be enough. 

also need to resample all data to the same time period - use afni to resample the mongoose data to the 693ms TR, and then recompute mongoose power for all subjects

paper theme: gamma and bold correlate but only under specific stimulus conditions and in certain areas, other gamma-bold correlations
may be largely due to motion, respiratory induced artifacts, spin history effects (in the BOLD FMRI signal). 

a non-ICA denoised approach? use the RAW FMRI to correlate with EEG? - see if this affects the motion artifats

presentation: whole brain neurovascular coupling in healthy human: implications for global signal regression
NVC
global signal regression
	what contributes to the global signal?
		motion, breathing, heart rate
	the brain is organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks fox2005, fransson2005, greicius2003

still need to get motion parameters from FMRI image time series

saturday - need to get shit ready because you will only have 1 day after to prepare for the presentation
	- get all slides done in skeleton form (need to solidify the basic message)
	- compute coupling in all states for all types of motion correction and artifact reduction
	- compute GSR-EEG coupling
	- know what you will present
	- know the basic message (title)
	
what is the basic message? you are using neurovascular coupling to resolve a long-held debate about global signal
regression.

show coupling differences between states are due to motion (sometimes) emily finn

first get the GSR results, then see what it looks like with and without GSR. implications follow. 

how to merge the motion and the GSR results? the motion results are matching because people claim GSR and global signal.
positive/negative correlations separated by 10.3 seconds, could this underly the early alpha correlation with BOLD

show t-value maps with and without global signal regression 
save mean t-value coupling across all brains for gsr and non-gsr
save mean t-value difference across all brains for non-gsr minus gsr 
RESULT: whole brain neurovascular coupling with/without GSR.
global signal correlation with all EEG voxels - with and without motion correction of EEG. 



show xcorr matrices of global signal with neural activity in each voxel (and different regions) 

GSR makes coupling weaker between two correlated regions, and artificial anti-coupling with othe regions. 

check global signal connectedness in each state. correlate that to NVC

still need: global signal coupling xcorr (2d), global signal voxel-wise avg coupling vs mc only coupling, global signal corr maps. 
	
need to correlate respiratory and heart rate ecg with bold, see what you get.
