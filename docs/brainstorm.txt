how to place dipoles and generate scalp topographies?
how to generate a source in 
just 'activate each scalp component' according to how the sources are placed?
-compare that to the real EEG  (erp) 

fmri brainstorm
tegan's electrode locations and consequently source activations are wack. why? they appear to be quite high up on the head, 
strangely. maybe they're still wrong?
electrode locations are wack. check the raw UTE to make sure they're in the right positions ie you're isolating the proper coordinates
