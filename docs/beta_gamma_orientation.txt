a new stimulus to better understand the neurophysiological basis of alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. 
alpha is feedback and gamma is feedforward. great...so what? we need a stimulus that affects alpha/beta but not gamma, and vice versa. perhaps

linearity differences in alpha/beta and gamma - gamma is linear to the stimulus while alpha/beta is not.
