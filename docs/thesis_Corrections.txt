thesis: 
talkk more about orientation in the gamma section
find out what 2nd plot in two components of gamma plot means 
global gamma figure show spike rate vs gamma
ing vs ping explain both or remove one from teh graph? 
skull scalp switch order
LFP modalities add letters A B etc
increase size of cortical ROIs from kerkoerle (or remove some) 
add column implant electrode slnated next to orientation columns 
explain the figures in pyramdial cell cylinder 
alpha add figure for how activity propagates through the layers to create the alpha rhythm 
link the orientation and motion tuning to the grating 

take 2

dipole equation after modalities figure
NRF have a 'b' with all sorted components 
describe better what broadband gamma is ie 100+Hz etc 
add the correlation map for the GLM analysis 
sub-population motion severity. 
fix the BOLD CBF figure in BOLD section (make it flow better, maybe have an ASL only section)
