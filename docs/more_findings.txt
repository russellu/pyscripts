more findings for the poster:

remove all files from desktop - should have around 200gb afterthis
reinstall neurodebian, freesurfer, fsl, afni, mrtrix etc 
get the files you will need to run the structure analysis (capybara + your own gamma subjects) 
send the capybara subjects to freesurfer 
get electrode locations for all subjects
get dave's coupling subjects do some processing on them 

ttest across voxels - coupling ttest different from zero, use this to mask correlations (p-values)
plot surfaces for different frequency bands
more findings:

get the ROI where you have the best correlations between alpha/beta and gamma and the stimulus, roi based
look where you have peak correlations, and make coupling matrices in that region. ie, across different states

otherwise, for the different bands find the highest correlating voxels in the mean across all states, and back-project those
to single subject space ROIs? 

for the coupling - look in the voxels that responded best to the stimulus, see how coupling in those voxels changes as a function of
state - first you have obviously the block design where you'll see the typical correlations
	step 1: get coupling kernels in gamma task for top voxels - should see the typical narrowband correlations 
	step 2: get coupling kernels for movie and rest - plot mean for different bands, get peak difference 

after ohbm - sukhman + karl + retinotopy all subjects

simple analyis: cross correlations, mean BOLD in V1 ROI vs different frequency bands xcorr

timeline:
tonight: coupling results, all subjects all states, kernel images in V1
	 coupling results, all subjects all states kernel images in RSNs (DMN, lateral vis, lingual, occipital, executive, motor
		group ICA, select components, back project to single subject spaces, select voxels within specific components 
		epic fail - components look weird AF. just get the components in the single subjects and use those
			design this figure - different DMN hubs in mean overlay, and show RSNs emanating from each one
	 coupling results, spectra in all states and areas (instead of time course, look at spectra at a specific time) 
	 structure results: finish EEG pre-processing (Capybara and synchrony), t1s on freesurfer (synchrony + capybara + hippo) 
	

today (Tuesday) - coupling:
		- get the final coupling figures - coupling in different networks, kernel and time series for different frequency bands
		- get the inside vs outside figure - ERSP in response to one stimulus type, and time series alpha/beta vs BOLD (intro/methods)
		- get the ICA denoising figures - noise components vs signal, and grad/bcg denoising figures as well 
		- need something a bit more quantitative also - how can you quantify these coupling results? 
	1) gradient/bcg/ICA denoising

structure - try to get to the point you were at earlier when you made the previous figures 
	  - remember there are two populations - 7 subjects simultaneous, and 22 subjects separately recorded. 

wednesday: 1) get all gamma subjects cleaned EEG data. (power in electrodes, trial denoised, save mean stimulus types). 
	   2) get all white norms using greg's script for all gamma subjects. 


some findings: movie stimulus has the same delay in alpha/beta as event-related stimulus, which has the same delay as gamma
for rest, the delay changes by around 2.5 seconds in alpha/beta, getting longer. also, for rest there is a significantly higher positive correlation in beta
than in movie which is suppressed. 
# of voxels movie vs rest - more full brain correlations in alpha for movie than rest, more theta correlations in movie/block than rest (whole brain) 
positive DMN-gamma correlations in rest but not movie or task
network correlations with the hrt - 
significant zero-lag correlation with alpha - increased alpha causes decreased bold, or vice versa? 
resting state beta correlations with DMN - much stronger at 0s time lag (positive) than hrf delayed negative correlations
