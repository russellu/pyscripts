alpha rhythm - what is it
what is neural activit? 

global signal mask vs visual cortex mask when explaining global signal

inside vs outside comparison	

resting state only - show all states, collapse across all states. 
emphasize final result (GSR is good)
correlations relative to noise

slide 11 more clear

default mode network - define beforehand
correlation curve (goense), electrodes, completely non-invasive
brainstorm minimun norm estimates 
murphy, fox neuroimage (voxel wise anti-correlations)

1) choose between two correlation spectra: gsr or non-gsr (show alpha/beta blue spot)
2) ica denoising affects results
3) show brainvision pipeline
4) show alpha/beta voxel-wise correlations with BOLD gs
5)
