in_app billing overview
in app billing api: the application accesses the in-app billing service using an API that is exposed by the google 
play app installed on the device. the google play app then conveys requests and responses between the application and
the google play server. in practice, the application never directly communicates with the google play server. instead,
the app sends requests to the google play app over interprocess communication and receives responses from the google
play app. you application does not manage any network connections between itself and the google play server. 
you can implement in-app billing only in applications that you publish through google play. to complete in app purchase
requests the google play app must be able to access the google play server over the network.
