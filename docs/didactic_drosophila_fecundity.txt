abstract:
presence of artificial light is expanding to the extent that species may never experience natural darkness. 
effect of chronic exposure to different night time lighting intensities on growth, reproduction, and survival in drosophila. 
3 generations under ALAN treatments 0,1,10,100 lux, explore variation in oviposition, # eggs, juvenile growth/survival and adult survival.
in the presence of ALAN, probability of eggs and #eggs reduced, but juvenile development was unchanged. 
they demonstrate for the first time a relationship between ALAN and adult survival. 

introduction:
majority of animal species have an evolutionary history that involves a predictable daily cycle characterized by a  bright day (200,000lux) and a 
dark night (0-0.03lux). accordingly, physiological and behavioral traits have evolved synchronized to this cycle (such as sleep). 
however recent anthropogenic light sources have significantly altered this environment. nights are significantly brighter now than at any point in history, 
and organisms living today rarely if ever experience total dark. disruption to the nocturnal photic environment is linked with corresponding biological shifts
at individual, population, and ecosystem levels.

(see reviews).

chronic exposure to <10lx correlates with fitness traits such as reproduction and juvenile growth. epidemiological demonstrate correlation between dim ALAN 
exposure and cancer risk as well as tumor growth, immune suppression, and obesity. 

(Cho et al 2015, review light vs cancer risk)

however, relatively few studies have investigated invertebrate physiology in response to light.
