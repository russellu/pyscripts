eeg-fmri sleep study

#1: denoise EEG data in scalp space: gradient, bcg, and ICA.
	(need to figure out how MNE works for ICA component subtraction)
	

#2: isolate well known FMRI components (default mode, visual, executive control, etc)
	

#3: compute coupling between these networks and clean EEG scalp space power
	as a function of sleep stage
	look at power as a function of sleep stage	


goal by christmas: re-submit distance paper, have rough results for sleep paper, 400 contacts on linkedin, start exploring job opportunities
more. set up a collaboration with 

presentation:
goals: comprehensible and impactful, you want the presentation to be easily understood, and also be very important

slides: 
1) introduce sleep and sleep stages, scoring of sleep based on EEG
2) introduce EEG-FMRI, montreal, subject pool
3) introduce ICA and the need for ICA
4) introduce some common FMRI networks
5) results: network #1
6) results: network #2
7) results: other networks
8) 

results:

EEG and BOLD power during different sleep stages
	- concatenate the bandpass-shifted epochs, and compute power over the concatenated timeseries
	- get the voxel-wise and electrode-wise differences due to sleep stage

EEG and BOLD correlation during different sleep stages
	-> hrf-convolved EEG in all frequency bands vs BOLD in all components 
	-> hrf-convolved EEG vs voxel-specific BOLD

tomorrow: get these results in the single subject, replicate them in the day2 scan, and get the processing running on more subjects

how to elegantly write a function to concatenate and compute psd

1) get trigger onset times relative to sample rate of data you are processing
2) concatenate
3) psd

-> this should be applicable to both EEG and FMRI
