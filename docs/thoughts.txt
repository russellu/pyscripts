may 8th is the predoc  - today it is april 23.
you have 15 days (just over 2 weeks) to prepare for the pre-doc. start spending minimum 8hrs a day studying
by next wednesday - finish all martin's questions, 10 minute polished ppt
by the following wednesday, finish JF's questions, 10 minute polished ppt (present both to kevin) 
final week - review the literature for your own project, practice your own ppt every day (And add things/polish), and practice JF/martin's 
questions every day while reviewing and taking more notes on the topics. 
tomorrow (23) - test extensively the app, and make all the final touches
then on the evenings of the week 23-30, finish the monetization and release on the google play store. 
how are you going to market the app? 
stick to simple things like the app store logo, and description - market it as a forex training game, where you can train on
news, specific time slots, or continuous data. 
if you could find an indicator that actualy performs better than chance and use that it would be great, but it doesn't appear to be
the case. 

add a t-test of your results vs randomly generated results - to see if your results are actually better than chance. 

next idea - super simple, and use it to streamline the button creation, and persistence + menu - make an object timer that allows you to 
track the times of different events - event name, logo, etc. 5 free tracked events + add, and then unlock adds and more events by paying
after that is done, you will have two apps in the app store (release them on multiple stores) and you will have an idea of how many 
downloads to expect/what kind of revenue you will generate. you can either continue working on small apps like that (just clone a bunch of
different concepts) or make a larger app (Game).
