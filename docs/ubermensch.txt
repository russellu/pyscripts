ubermensch day:

7am wake up, drink glass of water, take vitamin d, dress, drive to work. be at work 30 minutes after rolling out of bed
7:30am pop open laptop and check emails, respond to urgent, take note of anything that requires attention.
7:35am put pot of coffee on (1 liter of black coffee for my morning). drink it on an empty stomach
7:35am write down coding goals for the day. what do i need to accomplish to stay on track with my long term goals?
7:40am start coding. pour coffee. enter flow state for next 4:20. 
	the morning session is where i tackle my most cognitively demanding work. tough programming problems mostly that need to be grinded out
12:00pm break for lunch. get food from cafeteria downstairs and read TRP reddit or watch entertaining youtube for 45 minutes while eating.
12:45pm back to work, but switch gears and now focus on phd work, analyzing and writing up results from previous experiments, or conducting new experiments
4:00pm eat and take another 45 minute break. 
4:45pm go back to either working on app or phd stuff for a few more hours
8:00pm take some pre-workout pills and head to the gym, 5x5, squat deep and heavy. imagine your massive glutes pounding some hoe from work as motivation
9:15pm take off from gym, head home, pick up some food on way back. suck on a hard candy as you drive home to replenish blood glucose and start recovery
9:30 arrive home. bang girlfriend, watch a few episodes to unwind. shower and sleep by 11:00pm
11pm-7am: 8hrs of uninterrupted sleep. wake up feeling ready to conquer the world once again

totals: 1h15 at gym, 30-45 minutes in transit, 1h30 work break, 1h30 home unwind, 4h20+3h15+3h15 = ~11h work
