structure vs gamma paper:

structural measure #1: distance from electrode to active cortex
structural measure #2: cortical cancellation index - over ROI, possibly scaled by size of ROI? 
structural measure #3: size of ROI - #voxels exceeding a certain correlation threshold 
	3 key elements that determine a single subject's EEG gamma response

subjects with large, open-field cortices closer to electrode will have a stronger gamma band response
the inter-subject differences in gamma response are mostly due to macroscopic structural differences 

by tomorrow night: inot, and distance, vs gamma power, for both groups, main figures, as well as log fit
another structural parameter: breaking up distance into cortical tissue (gray/white) and skull/skin, quantifying these in various
subjects, and correlating those to see which contributes most on its own (ie, distance from cortex to electrode, skull, etc) 

tonight: get i0 for badger subs, and quantify the tissue using the vector method. 

introduction: EEG, brain rhythms, visually induce gamma, peak frequency and amplitude.
relationship of these measures to various cognitive and psychiatric disorders
relationship of these measures to anatomical variables in the healthy human
what this study will address.
