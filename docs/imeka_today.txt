add all rois, anatomies, etc 
get selection working for all rois and anatomies 

finish veins/arteries with button
finish subcortical/cortical selection
finish selection with labels 
finish hemisphere selection 

remaining:

finish left/right hemisphere selection
toggle subcortical/cortical areas on/off, and make it so the buttons turn green
finish the selection for both ROIs and tracks

for the selection rois, need to do the following:
1) only select when a click or a tap happens (not when it clicks and drags)
2) downsample the ROIs to use less cpu power on the collider but use the real ROIs to display the cortex
3) add the tractography ROIs 
	only show the bundle name if it is active
4) only activate the click when the hemispheres are active (otherwise it will occlude the subcortical ROIs)
	when either the hemispheres are active, OR the ROI itself is active
	or, check the ROI to see if it is active, and ignore those which are not. 
5) add more legible names for all the areas/bundles (in the list) 

a background color option? - black/white/gray/green/red/etc 

first thing: make it so it only senses taps (done)
if the left/right cortex is active, show the region of interest
if not, show only if the subcortical 
bug when changing colors (makes all the tracks disappear) 
add functionality to the show all buttons
remove ROIs that were previously active 

the final problem will be syncing up the toggled lists with the tracks and subcortical ROIs
make it so the selection sphere takes precedence over all other selectable objects
