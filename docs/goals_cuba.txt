goals before cuba
#1) release another app on both android and app store (an enhanced auto-trading app with more pairs, etc).
	monetize, monetize, monetize - you want 10$ a day by christmas, and releasing a multi-platform app by mid october is key,
	that will give you time to develop and work on a new app and hopefull itself be making 10bucks a day by xmas. 
	if you can be making 10$ a day by christmas, that means ~4 months of coding = 10$ a day, so another 2 years = 24/4 = 8 80$ a
	day by the time you graduate (average scenario), best case scenario you're making 150-200$  a day, worst, <20-30. 	

	release your 2nd app for android only because it's already 3/4 done, you just need to get the data loading part done, and add
	a couple indicators/robo trader

keys to reaching this goal - don't get caught up in things like developing strategies (Takes time and is lazy work), news/facebook,
etc are all obviously out of the question. just focus and put your head down and work and you will get there.

#2) keep searching for a profitable strategy, and try to get significant progress on a demo account, ie, >10% gains using low leverage
	divide up the time - half on the strategy/blog/marketing, half on the apps. 

#3) coupling results finished and ready to submit to ISMRM,

#4) nifti loader finished, primitive mi-brain finished 
	some features:
