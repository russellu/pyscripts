T1, T2 relaxation and magnetization transfer in tissue at 3T.
T1,T2 and MT experiments were performed in vitro at 3T and 37deg C on a variety of tissues: mouse liver, muscle, and 
heart; rat spinal cord and kidney; bovine optic nerve, cartilage, and white/gray matter, and human blood. The MR params
were compared to those at 1.5T. as expected, the T2 relaxation time constants and quantitative MT parameters (MT exchange
rate, R, macromolecular pool fraction, M0B, and macromolecular T2 relaxation time) at 3T were similar to those at 1.5T. 
the T1 relaxation time values, however, increased significantly with field strength, and consequently, the phenomenological
MT parameter, magnetization transfer ratio, MTR, was lower by approximately 2-10%. collectively, these results provide a 
useful reference for optimization of pulse sequence parameters for MRI at 3T. 
intro: longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation time mechanisms are relevant in understanding water molecular 
dynamics in biological systems. T1, T2 relaxation times depend on the chemical and physical environments of water protons
in tissue. MRI contrast between normal and pathological tissue is often based on the differences in tissue microstructure,
and therefore different T1 and T2 relaxation times. T1, T2, and MT also provide quantitative assessment of tissue 
pathology, in particular offering information about the processess of demyelination and axonal loss, inflammation, 
infarction, white matter edema, tumor malignancy, and ischemia.
