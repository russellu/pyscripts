band-limited source localized power vs the bold signal in each voxel 
yields a 5d image - x,y,z,time,freq of correlations

step 1: data quality control: show outside components vs inside components, outside ERSP vs inside ERSP 
ersp: first 3 seconds of stimulus, and power below 
	high pass filtering vs low pass filtering - different gamma results - but for the resting state, what can you use? 
	obviously gamma will be stronger if you isolate gamma before running ICA, 
source-localized gamma power inside and outside? would be interesting to examine the spatial pattern, to see if it is preserved
inside and outside the scanner (ie, the alpha/beta and gamma - show in source space voxels) 

figure 1: inside vs outside, gamma band response, -2:3 seconds, and grand average response to all stimuli (with stimuli) 
ability to detect differences between stimulus types and power - correlation n=7, show that more power = better discrimination
-interesting experiment - see if you can correlate the ability to predict randomness with EEG response 
check the ability of high-filtered gamma to distinguish between stimulus type vs low-filtered gamma, check the 
show component topoplots, use them to re-select data, do the same for resting state continuous data. 
	-compare components you get inside the scanner with components you get outside the scanner in resting state 
	-power reduction due to ICA denoising? 
	next step - source localization, and get gamma in the voxel. 

source localization in the voxel - ground truth, compare time courses to multiplied time courses. 
save the cleaned data from a single subject (alex), load the head model structure in matlab, compute the time courses and compare
them to the time courses from the saved data

quality control - gamma topoplots for ica cleaned data (all components) both inside and outside the scanner - compare occipital gamma
with inside and outside scan in visual activation ROI (this will combine all methods together (source localization etc) 


you need to think in terms of final analysis - you want to compare single trials, and spontaneous eeg-fmri. 
so, you want to compare gamma across tasks and resting state, with bold in the same states. the question is how to best do this?
high-pass filtering the eeg data before comparing to BOLD on a single trial basis is a good approach, because it increases SNR in the
gamma band. however, this doesn't allow you to compare resting state fluctuations as effectively, because the gamma components are
localized primarily in V1. 

get the spatial overlap of gamma vs BOLD, alpha/beta vs BOLD in response to task. 
brainstorm - export subject's head mask and 

try sorting components by their single trial difference from 0% to 100% rnd
ie, gamma differences distinguish neural components from noise 
	-load the bv components and do the same on the source time series 


step 1: grad/bcg denoising + ICA - compare scalp maps and ERSP inside and outside the scanner
	high-frequency filtering and low frequency filtering - compare the ersp in response to both, and compare that to the outside
	the scanner data 

step 2: source localization of scalp space signal - compare frequency specific spatial patterns inside and outside the scanner

show the ica scalp map power before and after ICA - and before/after re-referencing - the re-referencing should remove effects in the
middle of the brain around the reference, but the power distribution should be relatively homogenous across the scalp, or maybe 
concentrated over the occipital (depends on the components you select) 


more stuff needs to be done for pre-processing - single trial denoising, and motion removal - improved bcg and gradient removal
you have till the 12 of june to finish both posters however, so time to start focusing on what you have and getting final results
what can you get out of the source space signals today? 
one subject - inside and outside - first look at outside scanner gamma signals in V1 - reconstruct the ERSP in source space, and 
save that as a power time series (you can run melodic on this map also) - try running melodic on broadband source space signals, ie
sum the power averaged over many frequency bands, down into smaller bins 
get the source space signal, get the BOLD signal, combine the two
step #1: get gamma power in source space for outside the scanner data
	a) remake head model (8mm) and re-register to FMRI/T1 
	b) save sources again - this time down-sampled with less voxels
	c) load and process in matlab, assign voxel gamma power values or save a 4d map
		i) save a 4d map
