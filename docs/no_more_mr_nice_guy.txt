no more mr nice guy - robert glover 

child development principles:
1) all children are born totally helpless
2) a child's greatest fear is abandonment
3) all children are ego-centered
4) all children have numerous abandonment experiences - their needs are not met in a timely, judicious manner
5) when a child has abandonment issues, he believes he is the cause
6) this naive misinterpretation creates toxic shame - a belief that he is 'bad'
7) children develop survival mechanisms to help cope with these abandonment issues, prevent the experiences
from re-occuring, and hide their badness from themselves and others
8) these survival mechanisms reflect the child's inherent powerlessness and naive view of himself and the world

abandonment => internalization of toxic shame => creation of survival mechanisms 

nice guys prevent themselves by getting what they want in love and life by :

1) seeking the approval of others
	having a pleasant, non-threatening voice (questioning tilt) 
	never getting angry 
	being a good worker
	being nice
	never offending anyone 
	seeking women's approval gives women the power to set the tone of the relationship 
2) trying to hide their perceived flaws and mistakes
	if you forget, break something, or are late
	if you don't understand something
	the DEER response - defend, excuse, explain, rationalize
	turning the tables and shame dumping 
	building walls using: humor, sarcasm, intellectualism, perfectionism, and isolation
	people are not drawn to perfection, but rather, shared interest, shared problems and life energy 

3) putting other people's needs and wants above their own
	you must begin seeking the approval of the only person who really matters - youself
	identify how you seek approval
	take better care of yourself
	use positive affirmations
		keep them fresh, say them often, and close your eyes when you repeat them
			"i am a strong and valuable person"
			"i am just entering my prime"
			"i get better every day"
			"i waste no time and get straight to the point"
			"i put myself first"
	make a list of things you use to get approval from other people, and focus on one thing at a time 
		a) rapport seeking in conversation
		b) giving away incriminating or embarassing information about yourself or people close to you
		c) moving out of the way of people, giving people more space, making yourself small 
			you can try consciously doing more of this behavior, to see how you feel and make it more noticeable
	do nice things for yourself - massage, dental work, take time off, relax, take walks - treat yourself
	next time you are traveling by yourself, try more of these breaking free activities 
	
	nice guys try to become 'low maintenance' or 'needless and wantless'
		stemming from childhood anxiety of not having your needs met in a timely manner 
	covert contracts - doing things so you will get something in return, in order to disguise the fact you have needs
	stop caretaking completely, or caretake more than usual, observe the effects this has on your state 

4) sacrificing their personal power and playing the role of victim
	the victim triangle
		1) the nice guy gives to others, hoping to get something in return
		2) when he doesn't get as much as he expected, he feels frustrated and resentful, he keeps score and isn't objective
		3) when this builds up, it can be unleashed in an emotional puke
	observe the ways you hurt the people you love:
		cutting remarks or hurtful jokes, embarassing them in public, frequently late, forgetting things they've asked of you,
		criticism, withdrawal
	since nice guys learn to sacrifice themselves in order to survive, recovery must center around learning to put themselves first
	and making their need a priority
	what happens when you put yourself first?
		1) you increase the likelihood of getting what you want and need
		2) you can give judiciously, and of what people truly need
		3) you can give without resentment and expectation
		4) you become less needy
		5) you become more attractive 
	make decisions yourself, not based on some comittee in your head of all your peers and loved ones.
		ask 'is this what i want? yes? then i'll do it.'
	nice guys tend to be wimpy victims, because their life circumstances require them to sacrifice their personal power
	list of ways nice guys try to create a smooth, problem free life:
		doing it right, playing it safe, anticipating and fixing, not rocking the boat, behing charming and helpful,
		never being a moment's problem, utilizing covert contracts, controlling and manipulating, caretaking and pleasing,
		witholding information, repressing feelings, avoiding problems and difficult situations	
	reclaiming personal power involves setting boundaries, developing integrity, and expressing feelings.
	pick one situation in your life where you routinely feel frustrated or out of control - is the difficulty a result of
	you trying to project the reality you want to believe unto it? if you had to accept the reality of the situation, how
	might that change your response to it? 
		meetings with Kevin in his office, to discuss pay, career, or article corrections/future articles
		projecting the reality you want to believe - you have invested all this time into the lab, and cling to the 
		belief that he knows best, because of the ben franklin effect - you don't want to believe that you wasted a bunch
		of time responding to his corrections, so you double down and accept it again. 
		the reality of the situation is kevin is not perfect, and your opinion is as good as his, and better in many
		cases especially when it is your own work. this will change your response because you will stick to your own ideas
		through acknowledging their validity and goodness 	
	by not talking about their feelings, nice guys are being selfish, claiming they don't want to hurt anyone, but really
	just trying to keep their own world smooth and under control 
	list one fear that has been controlling your life - the fear of not finishing your phd and having wasted the previous 4 years

5) disassociating themselves from other men and their own masculine energy
6) co-creating relationships that are less than satisfying
7) creating situations in which they do not have very much good sex
8) failing to live up to their full potential
