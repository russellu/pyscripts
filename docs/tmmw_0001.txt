tmmw: 
GET the sprite collisions FIXED for once and for all - have the collision with weapons working, and switching between 2-3
different attacks based on the controller. 
you can set it up to randomly execute attacks, or you can use a different type of attack with 3-4 separate buttons. 
one cool way would be to use the stabbing icon in the middle, and left/right slash on the sides.
so you push down, and the button you push down on is the one that starts to attack (stabbing, left, or right slash)
ie, a backhand, a forehand, or a stab. 
but start by just getting multiple attacks set up.

the next thing to do is probably to have some kind of battle between two sprites (after extensively testing with many 
rigid bodies at the same time). 
ie have 10-15 collidables inside your arena, and start hitting stuff around. 
by tuesday, have a sprite hitting balls in an arena with multiple attack animations. 

what about a defend animation?

GENERAL: 
pay parking tickets
deposit checks 
send insurance thing
pay hydro
clean house 
clean clothes
go to gym (weights) 

all this stuff can be done relatively easily (shouldn't take more than 1-2hr for general (Tickets etc) and another 2hr for
house/clothes (4hrs)
