SKAG single keyword ad group
need root keywords and adword editor

root keywords are the shortest tail of keywords that you're willing to bid on
for example, an online college could have "online college", "online degree", "online school", etc
then use synonyms: web college, digital college, internet college, etc

use broad, phrase and exact. why?
even if someone searches for a longer tail version search term triggered by phrase or modified broad match, your ad will still
be the most relevant possible ad in your account
if you split up your skags into 3 adgroups, you further dilute your data collection and testing will be even harder
set all the bids at the same amount, then adjust them later based on performance 

creating ads rules: keep the keyword in the headline and the path (display url), which will make the ad more relevant to the 
searcher leading to a higher CTR, leading to a higher quality score and other benefits
quality score - click through rate is the most important factor
how to improve quality score? do keyword research, including using long tails, perform keyword organization by splitting your 
keywords into tight, organized groups that can be more effectively tied to individual ad campaigns, refine ad text, optimize landing
pages, and add negative keywords 

anything your write in headline 2 and the description is up to you, you just want to make sure that the ads are different enough
to split test. 

you can then clone ad groups, and make new SKAGs with the synonym
