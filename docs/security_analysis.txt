try to incorporate actionable tips that you can apply to a company's balance sheet

value investing is the practice of purchasing securities or assetts for less than they are worth
value investors demonstrate their risk aversion by striving to avoid loss
the essential characteristics of a value investor: patience, discipline, and risk aversion 
what has worked in investing:
1) cheap stock (measured by price to book values, price-to earnings ratio, or dividend yields)
2) underperforming stocks (over 3-5 year periods) 

some run computers to identify statistically inexpensive companies 

today, most managers pay little or no attention to value criteria, instead concentrating on:
1) growth rate of company`s earnings
2) momentum of its share price
3) simply its inclusion in a market index 

companies that:
1) disappoint shareholders with lower than expected earnings
2) sudden management changes or accounting problems
3) ratings downgrades
are more likely to be sources of opportunity than strong performers. 

good businesses are:
1) those with strong barriers to entry
2) limited capital requirements
3) reliable customers
4) low risk of technological obsolescence
5) abundant growth opportunities
6) significant and growing free cash flow 

investment in high grade bonds and preferred stocks:
1) safety of interest and principal
	make sure the bond doesn't die out, like what happened with railway bonds in the early 1900s
2) future of interest rates and bond prices
	need to be sure that interest rates don't rise sharply in the future
3) the value of the dollar
	if the dollar will go down, prefer equities over bonds

four problems by which to guide investment practices:
1) the general future of corporation profits
2) the differential in quality between one type of company and another
3) the influence of interest rates on dividends or earning returns that he demands
4) the extent to which purchases and sales should be governed by the factor of timing as distinct from price
	timing cannot be done by technical analysis, but instead by under/over valuation analysis (fundamental) 

avoiding serious loss is a precondition for sustaining high rate of growth

in terms of forecasting stock prices, book value is almost useless
individual stocks are often cheap when a whole industry or group of securities has been sold down indiscriminantly 
look for stocks selling at less than their tangible worth (ie, with more cash on hand than the stock is worth) 
buy stocks with a substantial margin of safety - ie, oil stocks selling for less than their equipment is worth 

two vital rules
1) companies with stable earnings are easier to forecast and hence preferable	
	if a company has volatile earnings, you need to look back at least 10 years
2) use average earnings, not trends (avoid mistakes due to cyclical phenomena)
