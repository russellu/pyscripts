FMRI_stims:

rotating orientation
	rotate the grating for 8 minutes straight, and high-pass filter out the drifts (anything below the cycle of the wedge).
	
block design retinotopy
	do the quadrants separately, and the hemispheres/hemi-fields. do a full field block design as well. 
	quadrants: upper left/upper right, bottom left/bottom right, top/bottom, left/right. 
	split it up into 2 scans, with four parts. then do a shorter 3rd scan with full-field.
	10 second block design for wedge => 51 trials total, or 12 per stimulus type 

contrast? one more scan with varying contrast level block design? 5 reps each = 25 reps = 10 second trials. 

rotating wedge? 

goal is to get this submitted before ohbm/ismrm (as well as have app published). 
look at vasculature, distance, and cancellation (for retinotopy) 
alpha/beta does not care about amplitude => feedback is bullshit?
