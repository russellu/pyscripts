weaponNoWeapon.size() is too small
weaponNoWeapon is still the previous sprite's array? and now its on the new sprite which has a larger number of points?


basic version of weapon collisions is working now, and it works pretty well. 
some things to do: 
	1) need to reduce the number of points on the weapon (speed it up, right now it has like 600)
	2) change the collision part so that it actually only hurts at certain points on the weapon (ie if the guy gets
	hit by the side of the weapon it shouldn't hurt or should hurt much less). DONE
	3) add some animations showing where the collision took place (a 'BLAM' or whatever animation) 
		this will also show when the weapon is hitting something or when its just colliding with a normal body (DONE)
	4) make it so when the rigid body detects the collision, the same calculation is carried out as when the character
	detects the collision (STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE)
	5) when a collision is detected, you want to use the normals on the weapon, so you will have to save a batch of
	normals for each point on the enlarged weapon indices and then use that to index the normal of that particular
	weapon point - STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE (BIGGEST PROBLEM)
	6) have the "active indices" working so it only does a weapon collision when the weapon is active so to speak
	7) add more animations (2-3 more weapon animations) 
	8) add a target so you can see where you are attacking DONE(KINDA)

WHY is it not updating the crosshair when you move the controls?? 

next things to do: 
landscape
attack button (don't control orientation with attack, but control attack type) 
	=> you can also place some other buttons around the main attack icon 

adding more stuff to the attacks...once you get the attack pad working, with 3 different types of attack, and test the new
rotation scheme (make it more like dungeon quest, where the movement controls the orientation and the attack controls
only the attack type/special ability) and the pull-back should be to enter guard mode (so the sprite blocks more often)
once this is all working, you can go back to fixing the attack indices, and the weapon collisions. 

by the end of this, you should have the controls AND the attack animations all pretty much set in stone. 
goal is to have this done by the end of february, then you can start creating real content.
the first content to create will be adding another character and having battles (Actually this is an extension of controls)
