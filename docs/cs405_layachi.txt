stay away from heavy theory
focus on algorithmic aspects, make things intuitive 
chapter 4 - data mining techniques 
0 - start talking about data nominal, range, etc
0 - weka - how software works
1 - trees and rules (classification)
2 - bayes, bayes rule (ways to explain on youtube), use trees to explain
3 - clustering (kmeans)
4 - association rules, linear regression
5 - evaluation (cross validation, bootstrap)

weka, python for assignments 
incremental assignments - start with small assignments, build up
keep slides small dont overload slides
cover 5 chapters of book 
math on board - linear regression (will not ask about in test)


Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
