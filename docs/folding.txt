the contribution of folding to the EEG signal. if you have two areas that are more folded, or whose folds are cancelling
each other out, does this play a role or not? at what distance do folds cancel each other out? maybe at some point, they
just don't affect each other very much, like across hemispheres. 

30 2 minute rotations => 30 trials/angle, 40 angles, 30*40 = 1200 trials (better than 96 trials)
120/3 = 40 angles, smooth the EEG power with a gaussian 3 seconds each. 
continuous rotation, 10 minutes of data per scan

synchrony subjects: check relationship between alpha/beta and distance using raw signal (in good subjects only) or 
after subtracting only a few bad components. 
	obviously, within a single subject distance is going to play a huge role just based on the scalp topographies and
	the way that EEG responds best in the occipital lobe. but can folding also be used here, to separate their 
	contributions? distance within/across subjects will not have the same correlations (can put this in your 
	presentation as well). 
	so for example, you have subject #1 (you, for example) where up to cpz you may see at least some gamma power, 
	whereas in subject #2 you won't see ANY gamma power even in electrode oz. what gives? 
	how to quantify this? 

in a single subject, you can expect an inverse-squared relationship between distance and folding. check this in all the
current subjects you have available (n=8 and n=22) 

weird components. need to make sure you are denoising propery (ie, get the bad components out).
