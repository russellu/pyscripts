lessons learned from sfn 2018
the world of neuroscience is vast and unstructured - there is no time to waste on frivolous matters
the experience was humbling, in that you were exposed to the highest caliber science from 
modalities that supercede your own in basically every way. 
you can take this converence as a wake up call - there is no time to waste when pursuing your goals
in neuroscience or work. don't waste time messing around online, when you have so much to do. 
keep a sense of urgency - like you had the day before you left for the conference, working on your
poster and the results to get it ready in time.
