wireless recording in the peripheral nervous system with ultrasonic neural dust
highlights: first in-vivo electrophysiological recording with neural dust motes
2) passive, wireless, battery less EMG and ENG recording with mm-scale devices
3) recorded signals transmitted via ultrasonic backscatter from implanted neural dust motes
4) ultrasound as a scalable means of providing wireless power and communication

summary: 
1) deciphering and modulating bioelectric activity in the body to attain therapeutic effects in target organs.
2) current approaches rely on wires, creating problems for chronic use.
3) emerging wireless approaches lack size scalability necessary to interrogate small-diameter nerves.
4) conventional electrode-based techniques lack capability to record from nerves with high spatial resolution, or
record independently from many discrete sites within a bundle
5) neural dust is a wireless and scalable ultrasonic backscatter system for powering and communicating with 
implanted bioelectronics
6) ultrasound is effective at delivering power to devices in tissue
7) passive, battery-less communication using backscatter enables high fidelity transmission of EMG and ENG signals
from anesthetized rats

preparing the didactic: get the final version of the articles, get all supporting material, read through it a few
times, organize the talk in your mind, then put it on paper, then start creating specific slides

step 1) get the final version of all articles
step 2) organize the talk on paper
step 3) create slides
