today experiment with greg: 2-5pm - do greg's experiment first (1hr), and then run some different retinotopy experiments (mainly, the discrete, continuous, and SSVEP)
so you want to run the discrete grating retinotopy, the continuous grating retinotopy, the discrete SSVEP retinotopy, and the continuous SSVEP retinotopy.
do 30 minutes of each, should give 2 hrs of good retinotopy data. run the wedge in 2 minute blocks, and maybe try a rotating quadrant as well. a rotating quadrant
and a rotating octant should be the first two, then try the discrete SSVEP and the continuous SSVEP
other things? maybe try the annulus as well as the bars, for better PRF estimation? 120/2TR = 60 areas, /3TR = 40 areas, etc. 4 runs, 5 circles/run, 20 trials/area,
60 areas = 20*60 = 1200 trials. keep in mind also the EEG data can be smoothed. 
for discrete grating, do a full field as well. then, see if you can get a linear summation in different frequency bands (right + left = full, quads1+2+3+4 = full,etc)

greg's experiment: should be 16seconds/trial -> baseline, jitter, stim, rest, blink.

2 minute rotations => can this gamma retinotopic mapping be replaced by a different more continuous stimulus? could be another interesting thing to study. 
ie, watching movie vs gamma retinotopy. 

future experiments => receptive fields, but in a different space (concept space - trump, taylor swift, etc). 

today - different peak frequency, due to different orientation?? probably. 
what about different retinotopic areas? and different contours? 

distance dependence of EEG gamma power modulation 
across electrodes, visual areas, and subjects (n=64,25,12) 
ie, within closer electrodes, what causes it to vary more? does curvature have a significant contribution?
do different hemispheres cancel out? apparently not, in the gamma range. 
2 electrodes at equal distances in different subjects - still different gamma power -> distance plays a role but is not the only factor. 
ie, in alexandra you have electrodes as far away as the CPs registering gamma power increases in response to a visual stimulus, but in other subjects
such as alex you have no gamma power even in electrode Oz. 
so obviously, other factors play a role. skull thickness?  

what the FUCK is going on with the baseline subtraction of the power?
higher peak frequency in global gamma rhythm for vertical gratings? WHY? 
see what is different in BOLD response? 

vertical grating...orientation columns oscillate at a higher frequency for vertical orientations? why? 
inhibitory interneuron firing rate is higher? global gamma rhythm is the sum of all gamma, and is highly dependent on orientation tuning. 
orientation preferences - over-representation of vertical orientations? how would that lead to a higher peak frequency? 

across electrodes => inverse squared relationship
across cortical areas => ?
across subjects => linear?

simple EEG experiment: tomorrow, you can be the first subject
1) orientation tuning 16 orientations, 2s trials, 16*2*50 = 26 minutes
2) retinotopic tuning full+l/r+u/d+quad+oct = 1+2+2+4+8 = 17 areas, 2s trials = 17*2*50 = 28 minutes (and one catch condition)
=> <1hr experiment, get the following: alpha/bet and gamma orientation/retinotopic preferences
					linearity of alpha/beta and gamma responses
show a few things 1) gamma adds linearly to retinotopic stimulation, alpha/beta does not
		  2) gamma power and peak frequency depend on orientation, alpha/beta does not
		  3) 

how to modulate alpha/beta without affecting gamma? is this possible? 

title: orientation and retinotopic tuning of EEG alpha/beta and gamma rhythms
abstract: EEG alpha/beta and gamma rhythms both exhibit strong narrow band responses to grating type stimuli, but the functional selectivity
of these different rhythms is poorly understood. 

fixed effect vs non-parametric
