affiliate mantra

i pledge to spend no more than 50$ per day for the next 6 months on affiliate marketing. to support this, i will use extra money
from my savings account (700$/month) as well as leading a more frugal lifestyle. if i average 30$/day, thats 900$/month, which is doable. 
as i start to lose less and less money, i pledge to keep the "leverage" constant, ie, i will keep pushing the spend (limitless)
i pledge that i understand that this is not an easy endeavour, results will be somewhat random, and it may not go well at first. but i pledge
that i will persevere for not less than a period of 6 months (averaging 8hrs per day), and, if by that time am not seeing improvement, step
back and reconsider this choice.
