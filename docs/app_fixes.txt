update all tracks - what is the fastest way to test this to make sure it works?
could you put all bunles in their own separate fibermanager? would that make it more difficult
for the fiber filter? you could always just add in a global filtering mechanism later, once you
have these few features working on the existing setup 
in this case, fibermanager should hold its own bundles?
