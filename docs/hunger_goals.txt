being hungry physically makes you hungry in life. 
like today, you didn't eat until 3:30pm, and now you are eating again at 10:43. 
also, you worked on new goals and made progress in your app. 

goals: don't eat until you get home (EAt fruit if you must, from the store). and eat within an 8 hour window (Try to shrink
this down eventually). 
don't smoke weed. (don't buy any new weed after you are done this current batch, throw out all the roaches). 

goals:
by tomorrow: 3 new subjects (n=9), eyetracker data for one, eyetracker working on EEG computer, eyetracker working on your
own computer, grand average plots, forex app primitive version working (buttons, buy/sell, market trace)
reality: only got one subject (good one though, and made some small progress on app). 


grand average plots: grand average tuning, and tuning grand average 
grand average angle ERSP type things 
some findings: low gamma tuning, and low gamma for orientation not retinotopy. gamma is more tuned than alpha/beta to
orientation, but not to retinotopy. 

later: 
app:

think about the basic functionality that you want the app to possess: 
buy/sell, to ride the market. 
start with a few different currency
