eyetracker:
today: be able to save eye tracker data with epoch information into a mat file, and load that in matlab and compare with EEG single trial data. 
tomorrow: fix the setup and stimuli for the final configuration  

final stimulus - spatial and temporal frequency to modulate alpha/beta, while holding gamma constant - faster gratings, and lower spatial frequencies. 
another stimulus? you can get 30 parameters, 30 trials each from spatfreq, but you should test something else as well
maybe two plaids that rotate on top of each other, 360 degrees, or the retinotopy stimulus.
