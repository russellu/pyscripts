new_strategy: 

new strategy: buy the dips, sell the peaks, sort them into the lowest and highest possible bins, and then take the n bins from the
top and bottom, and use those

next step: get the threshold, and then run it through a simulation using the threshold - see if it gives the same result
(results will be slightly different obviously, because their are duplicate trades in the original, but it should be roughly
the same. if all is good, then repeat it in java eclipse, and finally, in dukascopy. forward test in dukascopy, then demo for 2
months, and if all goes well, go live. 

step 1: build a strategy that works, ie, find some attribute of the market that makes it predictable 
step 2: simulate the strategy using real time trading 
	simulating the strategy: just try to run it through, if it doesn't work, try to get the previous results first
