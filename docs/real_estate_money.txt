real estate and money

first things first: handle your personal finances - stop spending every paycheck, or even
worse, money you don't have, and SAVE. once you are able to handle your own personal 
financial situation, you will be able to properly invest and create wealth. until then, its
pointless to move on to bigger endeavours. 

goal #1: save 1000$ in a separate account and do not touch that money

current state of your bank account:
credit:
-4467.71
chequing
422.82

regular income:
1764.36 + 1300 = 3064.38
other income: 240 + 466.56 = 706.56

regular expenses: 
738.91 + 380 + 600 + 220  = 1938.91

subtract other income from card right away: 4467.71 - 706.56 = 3761
regular income - regular expenses = 3064.38 - 1938.91 = 1125.47

so basically 3 months to pay this shit off, if you are lucky. 

your net regular income is 1125, which means, once the card is payed off you should be able
to save 1 grand a month. 

GOAL: payed off credit card, and 3k in the bank by end of December 2018
