strategy #1: random entry, random exit
strategy #2: random entry, stop/take profit exit 
strategy #3: price crosses mvg entry, price crosses mvg exit 
strategy #4: price crosses mvg entry, stop/take profit exit
strategy #5: price crosses bband entry, price crosses bband exit
stragety #6: price crosses bband entry, stop/take profit exit 

or - just have an entry trigger and an exit trigger, and then adjust the parameters of these

entry triggers: mvg crossover, bband crossover, momentum (RSI, CCI, MACD)
exit triggers: same as entry but reversed, stop and take-profit 

looks like anything below 10-15 minute bars is going to get chopped up by the spread/noise. 

testing in matlab:
1) isolate a single currency (eurusd)
2) create condition matrices so you can test multiple strategies automatically
	have a vector of buy trigger values, sell trigger values, buy exit trigger values, sell exit trigger values 
3) you have vectors of 0, 1, and -1 for nothing, buy, and sell conditions. now test them against each other 
	try a single parameter first: against bband enter, against bband exit. 
4) found some strategies that seem to work pretty well - next step, get profit curve, (make sure its continuous) and then visualize

so basically the only thing that stands a chance of working is the bollinger band negative and possibly the bollinger band negative combined with aroon,
although they give pretty mmuch the same results. try optimizing these (with take profit and stop as well) and if you don't get a smooth profit curve, go back
to the app. 
got a decent overall average correlation (0.35 max) but not that reproducible. you can try using a more recent time period to see if that reproduces better.
also, try sorting or at least eliminating some of the worst currencies. 

get the correlation map across all time periods, and see if there's any significant predictive power in the correlation pattern from point a to point b
there actually appears to be some temporal consistency - whether this is due to the smearing effect or what, no idea, but worth trying a WFA to test.

use the close to calculate the profit/loss, but the high/low to calculate the exit
