traffic light simulation: create a simulation where you maximize the efficiency of the traffic light distribution across
the city. 

factors in the simulation: traffic, number of lights, duration of lights, and pedestrians (pedestrians are minor)


so basically start with a simple simulation: a 5x5 grid, with
