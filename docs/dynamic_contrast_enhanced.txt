Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI studies in oncology with an emphasis on quantification, validation and human studies
MRI, after administration of an extracellular, gadolinium based contrast agent, can be used to detect and 
characterize human tumors. the success of DCEMRI is dependent on its ability to demonstrate intrinsic differences
between a variety of tissues that affect contrast medium behavior. 

T1-weighted imaging: extracellular contrast media readily diffuse from the blood into the extracellular space of 
tissues at a rate determined by the permeability of the capillaries and their surface area. T1 relaxation time 
shortening caused by the contrast medium is the mechanism of tissue enhancement seen. the early phase or first pass
includes the arrival of contrast medium and lasts many cardiac cycles, in this phase the increased signal seen on
t1 weighted images arises from both the vascular and interstitial compartments. over a period lasting several 
minutes to half an hour, the contrast agent diffuses back into the vasculature from which it is excreted, contrast
medium elimination from slow exchange tissues such as fibrosis and necrosis occurs more slowly, explaining the 
persistent delayed enhancement characteristic of some tumors.
