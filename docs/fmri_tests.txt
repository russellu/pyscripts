next test with guillaume - go back to the shorter TR (1.9-2s) and slightly lower spatial resolution, test the stimulus again
rotating wedge and see if you can get a good gray matter segmentation and masked properly with the wedge. 
also, try to mask the screen or the inside of the coil, to get rid of the flickering effect. (try to think of a way to do this,
use sam's papers or something else like a felt sticky pad or something

other things that can come out of this experiment:
 
the vein thing: modeling the flow of deoxyhemoglobin from the veins to the cortex, using gradient echo bold and high resolution 
swi - is it possible to separate the contributions of the different folds to the draining vein signals?

electrode locations - before and after the experiment - see if they move. 
electrode locations - what else can you do, that others can't with precise locations? 
	- you can do enhanced source localization - compare the sources you measure with reconstructed sources based on precise locs
	- quality of source localization as a function of retinotopic area? do an SSVEP in each region 


before and after MRI gamma band response - 30 trials of the inward-moving annulus, before and after and inside the bore. 
30 trials or 4 minutes of gamma or something - just find a way to measure it before, during and after the MRI 
the effect of the other sequences on the EEG cap? using them to get some kind of measure like electrode location or something
based on how the electrodes are affected by the sequence - or to get some parameter like head size? try to correlate these 
artifacts to other measures for example, during the T1 maybe the artifact is different depending on the slice...

resting state correlations - functional coupling between thalamus and v1, vs eeg paremeters
thalamo-cortical coupling as a function of EEG state and EEG power - test this next time with guillaume
	(resting state correlations between thalamus and cortex, in eyes open, eyes closed, and gamma) 
		see if thalamo-cortical correlations are dependent on EEG power or EEG state 

papers you can already write: 
1) inside vs outside scanner - frontiers
2) inter-subject vs curvature, distance - neuroimage
3) eeg gamma tuning - jneur or neuroimage 

2 main focuses for this experiment: retinotopic mapping (30-40 minutes and resting state (20-30 minutes)
for the 'resting state' coupling, maybe have a stimulus that induces gamma power over an extended period, to see if you can
get spontaneous coupling with gamma in the resting state, and compare that to the gray screen or movie, ie, have 3-4 different
states and see if you can expand on the power dependence.
