topic: 
effects of light pollution on animal physiology

intro:
circadian rhythm
endogenous melatonin (indolamine melatonin, which is a neurotransmitter)
	first isolated from the bovine pineal gland, structure highly conserved across taxa
	circulating concentrations vary throughout 24h cycle, highest during dark, seasonal shifts
	melatonin - also a amphiphilic antioxidant
	
control of CR - how is it linked to light?
	exposure to LAN reduces melatonin, immune function significantly lowered in quail

cricket interpretation - we are in a deficit, so melatonin treatment may be effective in humans 
melatonin - THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS 

papers:

no effect on oxidative status 
fecundity in drosophila
light pollution affects behavior sleep physiology

today: understand circadian rhythm and how it is linked to light 
finish the first paper (crickets + melatonin methods + intro), finish another paper on the effects of light pollution (in humans) 

final paper: 
Let there be no light: The effect of bedside light on sleep quality and background electroencephalographic rhythms

so you will have 3 articles to critique, and the meta analysis to start it off. 
show wikipedia LX chart 

melatonin an anti-oxidant -> relationship to cancer incidence and light pollution? 
invent a question: what is melatonin, how is it produced/regulated by the brain/environment, and how are effects of light pollution mediated by it?

today: finish null result article, and make a critique slide for each article that you have 
finish the global change article 
re-read all your slides, and create outline
put together a presentation based on the outline and images.
