this week:
never forget that your ultimate purpose at bishops is to teach. they want high quality courses ideally 3-4 per semester
starting to get ready for the start of the semester (cs405, cs204)
while simultaneously advancing your independent cash flow ambitions (questrade, forex, games)
and laying ground work for next 5 years of research at bishops (NSERC)

maximize information intake - don't listen to music on your walks, listen to audiobooks. 
principle of focused effort - don't constantly switch tasks - focus on one thing until it is complete, then switch to something else
	-example, this week focus on data mining book until you finish first pass, then do app monetization later in the week with purchases

major synergies to exploit: 
1) app design cs 230/financial - create app taking into account lessons from google dev. docs, slated for release on google play
2) cs405 course design and algorithm understanding - use algos to analyze financial data, make students learn on your datasets
	get common problems in neuroimaging and financial fields and have students work on developing those

3) app design and NSERC application - get wearable devices, start testing/developing
	have students work on developing wearable devices - use this to select students for msc projects 

action items:
1) get research/support funding - call business office, set up phone answering machine (done) 
2) after (1), order some devices (apple watch, samsung watch) and a laptop for teaching your courses
3) finish CCV and NOI, submit DG NOI (done) 
4) release forex game on steam 
5) add in-app purchases to apple version of forex game

16) continue dieting down (1500 cals, 170 by sept) 
17) start two websites 1) for courses 2) for your finance apps (landing page also) - keep it generic (done) 

tomorrow - steam + apple app store monetization. gym. 

more synergy - focus app development away from finance and more on wearables 

the more streams of income you have the better.
monetary streams - house (1000$), google play (60$), apple store (0$), steam (0$)
intellectual streams - your own brain (1 article under review, NSERC+FRQNT), students (0), graduate students (0) 

eventual goal:
passive income stream from 3 sources: 1) online business (apps, games, etc) 2) real estate 3) equities and bonds, take from 1&2 for 3
