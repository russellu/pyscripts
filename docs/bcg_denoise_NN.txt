ideas for denoising BCG artifacts
denoising autoencoder:
-reconstruct the input based on AAS subtracted epochs
-reconstruct the input based on ecg channel only (doesn't work so well)
-reconstruct the input based on ICA denoised BCG components (works well on some subjects but not others)

the problem is one of the chicken and the egg - if you could have a denoised BCG for each subject, you could 
then easily learn the correct representation - however, you don't, so you have to base it on other factors that
approximate the BCG artifact (such as ECG and ICA)
adding noise to the input to better approximate the BCG? or just use dropout

the ECG channel carries quite a bit of info about the scalp channels, but not enough to remove it all
maybe if you train it for longer, or change the training parameters, this will work better
maybe if you combine the ECG with GFP or some other measure
