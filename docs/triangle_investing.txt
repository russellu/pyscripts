step3: find your own personal edge in online sales, figure out how to compete
step4: exit multiples or keep for cash flow

buy small cap stocks during a recession
some ideas: 

population shifts - people are not having kids, and are instead having pets. buy pet food companies 
pet insurance

idea #2 - video games. simply buy all the gaming companies and watch it go up over time 

idea #3 - virtual reality and AI  - who will benefit most from AI, and who will adopt it fastest? 
	self driving cars, online advertising companies...any company that will rely on machine learning

idea #4 - communication layers and name brands (internet service providers, 

idea #5 - healthcare - hip/knee replacements, etc 

avoid: media, payment services, bulk offerings and brick &mortar 

real estate: 

reading people refers to tenants
 -pay attention to subtle cues, like do they get frustrated easily, are they an organ doner, etc 

buy multi-plexes, easier to scale and manage, and better cashflow

step 1: the math filter
rent - take the 1.7-2.2% rule, also known as the 2% rule
mortgage payment - should equal 25% of the gross rent
cash on cash return > 10%

set up automatic alerts for multi-tenant properties in your area 
step 3 the 'i wouldn't mind living there test' 
use basic screens to see if the area is getting better or worse 1) jobs 2) crime 3) vacancy rates
eyeball tests - coffee shop vs payday loan shops. 

potential problems with the property
1) an older roof - typically replaced every 10-15 years, one-time cost
2) poor smells - smells like money, because poor smells bring down value but are easy to remove
3) appliances and basic interior - the age of all the appliances will impact your bills, 
	more important for multiplexes because it will likely affect all units (old furnace, plumbing, etc) 
no single issue (Besides roof) should be in the 5 figure range
if you can't calculate it easily, avoid. 	

we are focused on cashflow and yield, so we care about income, safety, and occupancy rates 

structural issues are a major red flag - AVOID
bad neighbourhood is a red flag - if you would move out due to lack of sleep etc - AVOID 
structural change to employment - see if everyone is working in the same industry, and if it is likely to go downhill 

buy with cash, then refinance after you have some cash flow from tenants 
being able to offer all cash means 1) you'll be financing shortly after putting tenants in the property  and
2) you'll be placing the property in an LLC 

cash offers are more attractive to the seller (faster closing) gives you more negotiation leverage, and interest 
rate will be lower if you take out a loan after the place is cash flow positive. 

questions about refinancing - can you get better rates if you pay cash then refinance 

getting the loan
1) shop for a loan, obtain pre-approval, and then bring in a property. 
	this could lead to delays if the property has issues that need to be fixed such as a faulty roof 
what the bank is looking for: residential, good location, no major structural issues, clear proof of income and solid credit

credit:
front end debt to income should be 25%, ie, if the payment is 2k/month, you need to gross 8k/month

step 7: inspection
paper inspection
a) disclosures - all issues that the seller knows about. 
b) taxes - can impact your bottom line, make sure it matches your ROI calculations, also be aware of re-assessments municipal
c) renter information - confirm the terms on all leases, rental rates, and security deposit amounts. don't forget to get the 
security back in settlement, and make sure you read every word of this agreements so the cash flow numbers add up correctly
d) utilities - check for irregular numbers, who pays, and make sure there are no leaks/irregular water numbers. 

physical inspection - should not be a contractor that you hire to inspect (conflict of interest)
	a) cracks/age issues - watch out for sloping floors, cracks in foundation, etc
	b) plumbing/electrical - look for any water related or electrical issues. 
	c) pest control
	d) asbestos and lead paint. 

1031 exchanges: 

2.5% for closing costs (of the properties value) 
repairs to be aware of (Can also be an opportunity)
1) replaced roof, which lasts 20 years
2) appliances, which last 10 years and cost a few thousand
3) heating and air conditioning, replaced every 10-15 years
4) flooring, replaced every 15 years
5) paint, every 5-10 years
6) cabinets/counters, replaced every 15 years or so

the 50% rule - half the rent will go towards expenses. 
occupancy rates - if you see a 25%+ return rental property, typically this is a dump with high turnover

negotiations: 
low-ball offer - offer less than you would be willing to pay. 
the key is to signal that you're serious, and not willing to pay the list price 
earnest money deposit - larger means you're more serious, and make sure you have the inspection contingency

making an offer and working with contingencies:
step1: calculate the value of the listed multi-tenant property. create an offer with the midpoint below your max price
step2: select real estate agent, craft offer including who it is to, the amount, how you obtain the money, when you want to close,
and what contingencies you want to include
a 10% security deposit can also be used, to show the seller how serious you are. 

property management - do it yourself first for the first few years, and then hire someone 

screening tenants: 
income first - call the company they supposedly work for
then check rental history but this isn't a deal breaker, ask how they treated the property and if they paid rent, how much etc
