(keep it under 100 mB) 

integrate both subjects into the app with a change subjects button
downsample bundles using mr_resample, convert bundles to iso-surface (for selection tool)
	add small description to each bundle (with a little information symbol beside it)
add FMRI ROIs and surfaces for both subjects
add venous and arterial images (assuming you have both) 
fix any small lingering bugs - selection sphere and color changes when adding new tracks 

finish all the image processing first (make sure its less than 60 mb) then do the final bug fixing and feature addition

get the RSNS
get the veins/arteries
get the anatomical areas (freesurfer)
get the BET surfaces (skull, scalp, etc) 
add functional connectivity mapping? 

remaining today: create iso-surfaces for all your new ROIs and cortical regions.
