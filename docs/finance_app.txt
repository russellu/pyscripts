stock analyzer app

two major parts 
1: deciding what stats to put in the final app
2: getting the real-time updates from google finance or similar instrument	

what is the purpose of your app, and how will you monetize it? you want a subscription-based service for this app (recurring payments)
build on graham's method of value investing, but add in technical analysis as well
why will users pay for your app? because it allows them to achieve above market returns on autopilot
your app must do the following:

1) keep up to date (monthly) statistics on each instrument's vital signs (dividend history, p/e, etc)
	-simfin + matlab to parse signals 

2) show real time intra-day market data with technical indicators (rsi, cci, etc) 
	-query alpha vantage, parse json, display chart

3) send notifications based on fundamental and technical analysis based on machine learning and data science
	-parse data in matlab, find what best predicts future price increases. 

4) allow for fake demo trading on margin

and of course, must use low battery, store data efficiently and reliably, manage network tranactions smoothly, etc

first thing to do: work on acquiring and plotting data from a single stock (use apple) - and plan the overall layout of the app

basic goal of app: combine technical and fundamental analysis to achieve high ROI
why users will buy (subscribe) to your app - to obtain high quality financial information to inform their daily trading activities
target market: retail traders looking to exceed index fund returns while hedging their risk
