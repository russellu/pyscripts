stimuli - size, orientation, contrast, randomization. 
size - full field to fovea (2deg). 
orientation - 0-360deg
contrast - 2% to 100%
randomization - 0% to 95% 

TR = ~2s, (high resolution 3d over occipital lobe)
5 minute scan duration, 2 scans/stimulus type, ~45 minutes total functional MRI

30 stimulus "types" per parameter, 10 minutes per parameter => 20 "trials" per parameter/type

higher peak frequency => more surface area? actually, it means more functional activation - so subjects with larger functional
activations have higher peak frequencies. how does this relate to larger stimulus size=> lower peak frequency? 
maybe subjects whose cortices exhibit more widespread activation 	

gonna have to add 4 cycles instead of just 2, cause you'll probably have to scrap the first cycle.

why would peak frequency correlate with BOLD activation - ie, more extensive BOLD activation = higher peak frequency? 
excitation/inhibition - higher peak frequency = more excitation or stronger input = higher BOLD activation. 
muthu's results are better explained by BOLD %change, showing that E/I balance.
higher contrast => more BOLD activation => higher peak frequency? subjects that perceive a higher contrast grating may also have
higher peak frequencies? the fact that %change or #voxels as well as peak frequency is so easily modulated across stimulus types
may affect this. (looking at inter-subject correlations in peak frequency may help to address this)
