alpha beta gamma bold 

summarize the results: BOLD contrast, retinotopy, and orientation, average across subjects. 

alpha/beta follows gamma for retinotopy but not contrast or orientation? 
find the areas where the BOLD signal follows the alpha/beta signal for contrast - ie areas where the BOLD response curve mirrors the alpha/beta response curve. 

implications: orientation tuning for alpha/beta and BOLD, and gamma and BOLD.
