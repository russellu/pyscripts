scalp distance to ROI for large group - instead of electrodes  	
BEM to get different conductivity layers 
LOC - voxel wise curvature metrics, or keep LOC and use calcarine mask instead 
CMF - more reason to discard peak freq?
use Robson labels to get anatomical and functional extents

mris_anatomical_stats
you can use mri_label2label to map the label from one subject to others

show correlation over different electrodes
proportion of FMRI voxels in V1 mask, use that instead of lateral occipital cortex? 

curvature stats:

look only in calcarine, 

show another scatter plot of skull thickness-surrogate vs gamma, and show two subjects iso-surface in fibernavigator
first get the correlation curve for the roi distance as a function of frequency
check out the excinh paper, for examples on how to make figures - get a more advanced procall function.
