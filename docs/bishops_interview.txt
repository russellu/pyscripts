bishops interview

1) scan courses, figure out which ones you could teach
	which would you be best suited to teach? 
	a) introduction to programming
		maybe switch the language to c#, more emphasis on functional programming
	b) developing mobile apps (unity)
	c) computer ethics
		history background, many philosophy courses
	d) data structures
		high marks in these courses (90+%)
	e) scientific programming
	f) programming mobile apps
		unity
	g) computer games design
		unity game engine + basic opengl 
	h) image processing, computer vision
		more focus on machine learning, convolutional neural nets, LSTM etc, use python
		statistical analyis

data science job postings
	python and sql
	statistical analysis
	process, clean, and verify integrity of data sets

2) in what ways would you change/improve the curriculum (especially relative to what it was when you were there)
	more data science heavy emphasis - machine learning, 
	introduce a new course for data science and machine learning
		get datasets specifically from industry/machine learning challenges

3) how would you integrate undergrads into your research?  
4) salary - don't ask for too much up front 
	75000, because you have no teaching experience

questions: 
1) why do you want the job?
	i came in today because i'm very interested in 
	why do i want to work at bishops? i went to school here for 4 years, i enjoy the environment and atmosphere, teaching
	being a computer science prof in my home town would be like a dream come true
	i believe combining computer science and medical imaging is one of the hottest topics right now
	usherbrooke and bishops computer science collaborations could advance both fields 
2) with so many talented candidates, why should we hire you?
	answer with what the job entails and how you've handled similar situations
3) where do you see yourself in 5 years?
	
4) what do you bring to our team?

bishops has around 100 undergrand and 100 masters students 

thesis based master's program
group of research on topology, computation and imagery: develop an algorithmic and combinatorial approach to abstract structures of 
topology with the aim of applying them in science and engineering
first specific goal is to enhance understanding of the critical zones in self-intersection of imaged curves and surfaces where mesh 
generation techniques break due to the singularity of the gradient vector field (see freesurfer)
