grant writing 101 
rules #1: 
plan ahead 
start in advance 
revise, revise, revise
keep it focused and simple
prove that it is possible
prove that you can do it 

start with a hypothesis: tentative explanation of a phenomenon that can be tested 
example : demyelinated lesions in cortical gray matter can be detected using MRI

parts of a grant:
summary page
proposal
supporting documents (Appendices)
budge (quotes) 

summary page: motivation, proposed work (what will you do for the next 3-5 years), significance
know your audience, and customize your grant towards that audience 

motivation: what is the problem addressed, why should i care? 
significance: why is it important? relevance and novelty, will the world be a better place, CIHR stress on disease/healthy 
	look at the mandate of the institute and tailor your grant towards that

give the reviewer's the words "this will significantly improve treatment" 

proposal: intro, background/prev work/prelim data, hypothesis, rationale, specific aims, experimental plans/methods, significance
sample size calculations 

cihr - go to the website, look up the buzzwords, and put those in the grant 
use gantt chart - master's and phd also 
write reviews on the topic
use internal peer reviews (find out at the institute who is in charge) 
find the instructions to reviewers - what the reviewers should value
