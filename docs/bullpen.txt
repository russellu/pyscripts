melee creature combat, live + turn based

select melee creatures, go into combat against other creatures
different types of creature have different benefits, which allows them to exist in certain combinations.

creatures have fundamental stats:

range - how far away can they attack from?
attack force (strength) - how much does the attack affect the enemy velocity?
attack frequency - how often does the creature attack?
mass - how heavy is the creature?
position - where is the creature?
orientation - what direction is the creature facing?

creatures can block damage based on their orientation, shield, and attack mode (animation index)

a very simple level:
1) select creatures from list and equip creatures
2) start combat
3) heal creatures and create new creatures (to adapt)

ie, start with a barracks to create basic creatures. can create x creatures per game, to match enemy's output. 
use the red-alert qeue to create units 
tunnel through the level dynamically, like dungeon keeper but more dynamic
