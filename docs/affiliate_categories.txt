my

domain name - look up competitors, get their keywords, add it to your domain, try to make it general
get a base legal, insurance, health, and household website - that should cover the majority of offers (maybe a cash/debt one too) 
get the auto-insurance site up and running, then you should have 4 offers active and you can start running campaigns and optimizing.set your budge to 50$/day
so 3-5 calls per campaign per day
