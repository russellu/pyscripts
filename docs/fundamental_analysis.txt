fundamental analysis:

look for things that can be automated
look for trends
reits (look for real estate that will increase in the future) 

sustainable competitive advantage is provided by:
1) a unique competitive position
2) clear tradeoffs and choices vis a vis competitiors
3) activities tailored to the companies strategy
4) a high degree of fit across the activities (it is the activity system, not the parts that ensure sustainability
5) a high degree of operational effectiveness

management: attend conference calls and listen for candor or beating around the bush
the majority of the company founder`s wealth should still be in the stock
the industry: red flag if company serves only a small number of customers
industry growth - is the industry expanding? keep an eye on technological trends

financial statements: a gold mine of information
the balance sheet represents a record of the companies assets, liabilities, and equity at a given time.
assets = liabilities + shareholder's equity
the income statement measures a company's performance over a given timeframe: revenues, expenses, and profits 
statement of cash flow: a record of the company's cash inflows and outflows over a given time period: 
	1) operating cash flow, generated from day to day operations
	2) cash from investing (CFI) cash used for investing in assets, and proceeds from sale of other businesses or assets
	3) cash received or issued in the borrowing of funds

cash flow is a more conservative, harder to manipulate metric than earnings, which accountants can tweak

10k and 10q: the SEC requires periodic filings detailing financial activities including the above. all this can be found in 10q or 10k
manager's discussion and analysis of 10k: 
	1) how candid and accurate are the manager's comments?
	2) does management discuss significant financial trends over the past few years?
	3) how clear are the comments? do the yhave something to hide?
	4) do they mention potential risks moving forward?

auditor's report: recounts the responsibilities of auditor, and parts of financial statements that were audited
lists how generally accepted accounting principles were applied, and where
provides the auditor's opinion on the financial statements of the company being audited

footnotes list important information not included in the actual ledgers, such as outstanding leases, maturity dates of outstanding debt

the income statement:
the first financial statement you will come across in a quarterly or annual SEC filing
	contains revenue, earnings, and earnings per share.
shows how much money the company generated, how much it spent, and the difference between the two
lets investors know how well the company is doing - whether or not it is making money. high profit margins signal strong fundamentals
sales growth is the best way for a company to increase profits. the best revenue are those that continue year in year out

expenses: two most common are costs of goods solds (COGS) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) 

PROFIT = REVENUE - EXPENSES
gross profit is revenue minus cost of goods sold. high gross margins means more money for R&D and marketing

be on the lookout for downward trends in gross margin rate over time
operating profit is equal to revenues minus the cost of sales and SG&A
operating profit measures how much cash the company throws off, and some consider it a more reliable measure than net earnings

net income is the bottom line, and the figure people refer to when they use the word profit or earnings
companies with low profit margins can get wiped out in a downturn

increasing sales is the first sign of strong fundamentals, rising margins indicate increasing efficiency and profitability. look for 
significant changes in revenues, cost of goods sold, and sg&a to get a sense of the company`s fundamentals

the balance sheet: the balance sheet highlights the financial health of a company and is an integral part of financial statements
tells you how much the company owes and how much it owns, the differences is shareholder equity or net assets

the big 3: assets, liabilities, and equity

assets: current and non-current, current are likely to be used up or converted to cash within one business cycle or 12 months
three important current asset items are 1) cash 2) inventories 3) accounts receivables
lots of cash is a good sign, means protection in tough times, and more options for future growth, increasing cash reserves is a strong sign
`stale` cash may also be a bad sign, signaling less investment opportunities, or poor management
inventories are products that haven`t sold, inventory turnover (costs of goods sold / average turnover) measures how quickly the company
is moving goods through the warehouse to customers.
if inventory grows faster than sales, it is almost always a sign of deteriorating fundamentals
receivables are uncollected bills, if its taking too long to collect, could be a bad sign

non-current assets are anything that aren't current assets such as property, plant, and equipment. its possible for companies to inflate this
number. 

liabilities: current (must be paid within a year) and non-current (bank and bondholder debt)
falling debt levels are a good sign, as is having more assets than liabilities. 

the quick ratio: subtract inventory from current assets and divide by current liabilities. if >1, company has enough cash and liquid assets
to cover its short term debt obligations

equity represents what shareholder's own, is often called shareholder's equity. equity = total assets - total liabilities
the two important equity terms are paid-in-capital and retained earnings
paid in capital: the amount of money shareholders paid when stock was first offered. retained earnings are a tally of the money the company
has chosen to re-invest rather than pay to shareholders, look closely at how it is put to use by the company

the cash flow statement:
how much cash goes in and comes out of the company in a year or quarter
the difference between the cash flow statement and income statement is accrual accounting. the income statement includes non-cash revenues
or expenses. 

the cash flow statement is crucial to understanding a company's fundamentals, shows how company can pay for its operation and future growth
one of the most important features is a company's ability to produce cash

three sections of the cash flow statement:

cash flow from
1) operations
	cash from sales of goods less the amount required to produce goods
	good sign when cash flow from operations goes up, watch out for widening gap between reported earnings and operations cash flow
2) financing
	selling stock or bonds, or borrowing from a bank, paying back a bank, or dividend payments
3) investment
	the amount of cash spent buying new equipment, other companies, etc
	should re-invest at minimum the rate of depreciation, otherwise, the cash flow is artificially high

cash flow statement considerations:
savvy investors are attracted to companies that produces plenty of free cash flow (FCF) 
free cash flow is the excess cash produced by the company, and can be returned to shareholders or re-invested without hurting operation

the most common method of calculating free cash flow is: 
net income + amortization deprectiation - changes in working capital - capital expenditures
company should be able to pay for the investing figure out of operations without having to rely on outside financing
the company's ability to pay for its own operations and growth signals to investors that it has very strong fundamentals

valuation: the current value of a company is simply the present value of future cash flows attributable to shareholders
discounted cash flow is a valuable metric used to calculate a company's value, and make investment decisions (under/overvalued)

ratio valuation: financial ratios are mathematical calculations using figures mainly from financial statements, used to gain an idea
of a company's valuation and financial performance. some of the most well known valuation ratios are price-to-earnings and price-to-book
price-to book compares the company's book value to the price per share

conclusion: never blindly invest in a company. always understand what it does, its market, and the industry in which it operates. the financial
statement is one of the most important areas to look when making investment decisions
