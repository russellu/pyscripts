study the undershoot as a function of venous density? maybe the undershoot is strongest in areas where there are larger
veins?

titles for talk tomorrow

outline slide
electric potential (formula) say how its a rough approximation (how the electrical potential might look given a dipole)
slide #6 -> MENTION structure and show the structural maps and electric potential 

BOLD comes out of nowhere (make it same as for EEG)

potential limitations -> put the BOLD
show the correlation schema many times (including at start) 
add 2 titles
add your within subject comparison (many electrodes), add a slide for why you think distance is good, and the 3 types 
of comparison. add your retinotopy data. 

subtract a full visual field activation map to normalize the signal (ie, to get a baseline?) => for the veins, and for EEG
