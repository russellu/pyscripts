fibernavigatory + other unity stuff: 

other unity:

forex app:

fix the forex app, lower the price to 7.99, and update the keywords. 
copy the description from the forex game app - add emojis and keywords, use bold text, etc. 
put the app (unity) on the apple app store, set that up at the same time as you do the imeka app.
make the spheres slightly larger and lighter so they stand out more
fix the margin % - right now its % but it should be %*100. also, it allows you to go into negatives, and then the trade direction gets reversed for some odd reason. 



rpg game: 
get more sprites (vice + cloudy, windless day), and good clothing. 

fibernavigator:

ipad, samsung, apple phone, and desktop
