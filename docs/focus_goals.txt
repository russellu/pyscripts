focus: you lack focus, which is why you aren't accomplishing what you want to accomplish
you set goals, but they are poorly defined, and you rarely make any real effort to stick to them. 

what good is it to set a goal if you aren't going to review it and make any real effort to achieve it? 

focus is really lacking at work especially - because of internet. you waste tons of time fucking around online on forums etc
this is bad. really bad, because these are your most productive years - and you're pissing them away minute by minute, hour by hour,
day by day. do you want to look back when you're 50 and realize you wasted your life on a bunch of forums and news sites? 
this is similar to picking your nose or scratching your head - its like the nose pick or head scratchof time wasting 

succesfull people break their days up into hours if not minutes - master your time, and you will master your life. time is the key. 
you don't have to plan your day exactly if you are focused, however. just work hard and you will accomplish your goals, the key is
putting in the time in an intelligent way, you don't have to be super precise, as long as you're accurate the precision will take 
care of itself over time.
