modeling stimulus induced EEG using deep neural networks 
from image (stimulus) to eeg response, through a neural network
from neural network to eeg response
from stimulus to neural network

predicting the next 1s of brain activity based on the previous 1s
	use neural networks to predict 
	use sparse autoencoder to predict BCG artifact 1s in advance
	predicting EEG 1-2s in advance - apply TMS pulses 
	predicting EEG - for BCI - compare keystrokes with EEG activity 
	predictive autoencoding for EEG denoising - predict a time series that optimally decodes
	the stimulus of interest? 
	optimize the stimulus contrast using deep neural networks. how would this map to a typical
	DNN architecture? 
	you could map to a one-hot encoding of stimulus type, but this wouldn't give you a time-series
	you could map to a filtered representation of the time-series
	or predict using the rectified gamma time series. 
	creating a windowed TF using neural network architecture
	autoencoder over phase and magnitude, rather than time domain
	reconstruction of heartbeat from electrode rather than vice-versa
	ground truth - easy for visual stimuli, harder for hand movements etc
	convert T1 to swi and vice versa 

day predictor app - app that tracks your movements, and predicts what you will be doing from day
to day.

generative models to create stimuli from neuronal spectra and vice versa - explaining the double
peak.
