phd: this weekend : 16 hrs on predoc - finish both Martin and JF's sections - martin's just do the last question
	health complications of leaky bbb + finish the things you need to update on the other slides, JF will take more
	research but finish that one paper and then get two basic references that address his question. 

hobby/passive income:
finish the purchase testing (get the purchase test downloaded on phone, alpha test etc)
learn joomla, so you can build a website and start selling stuff/updating like a blog (Forex findings, medical results, thoughts)
finish the persistence tutorial (vogella), implement that in your app
finish the color for locked/unlocked currencies
get an auto-trader strategy working, even if its only a few pips profit - worst case, its a scam auto-trader that only works
on the data you have trained it on - best case, it works by using the walk-forward analysis (keep testing this) 
	what is a fast way to continuously test strategies, and combine different strategies?
	take profit/stop loss optimization (SIMPLE STRATEGY) - test it on all time frames, and all currencies
	1) test take profit/stop loss for all currencies and time frames
	2) find a price action pattern or indicator that leads to a consistent profit (k-means of previous n time points,
	clustering previous n differences, candles, etc)  - you actually had a decent candle scheme working earlier
		a) need to make this more streamlined, and combine with the TP/stop loss (different time frames)
	need to "industrialize" this process, ie, have a way to see if it is gonna be feasible on all currencies etc
	so basically the half and half method works pretty well - optimize on half or 3/4, test on other half or 3/4
		you will see this works well for some things like the TP/STOP but not for others. 
		

the game - start thinking more about the segmentation/image processor in matlab, for the game sprites. 
	 - re-vamping of the physics engine which is FUCKED right now - its decently fast (50+ objects), but is probably not gonna
	get much faster without a good understanding of shaders etc, if you can even do that 
	lighting is important, and shadows

health:
take two more weeks off (for headaches) then go back to the gym. stick to the alpha diet (high protein and fruit/veg)

no more fucking around watching movies - imagine if you spent 2hrs a day actually being productive instead of watching movies!
forex is random bullshit. no two ways about it, there is simply now way to beat the market consistently.
