app ideas

games - simple games like the sphere or rainbow puke could be easily made 
games - simple games like ant colony digging, or dungeon keeper type games

	try to make a simple dungeon keeper type game, this is ideal for mobile

start with a scrollable map that you can select quads from to destroy. then add the imps 
just a bunch of cubes that you can select with a touch. 

goals for today: proper lighting, uv, and be able to select individual cubes and add many cubes in multiple meshes
test the limits of the android device for # cubes with textures

each tile is a cube with textures. you can create the tilemap so that it looks continuous from one part of the cube to another

most basic thing to start with: a floor with a tile of cubes, you select the cubes to remove them and reveal the floor.
use the same type of camera ask dungeon keeper uses, ie almost top down, but you can rotate and zoom.
