what does google do?
google uses a crawler to follow links on the web, saving indices of a page in a giant database called the index. google comes around more or less often 
depending on the amount of traffic at your site. 
for google to notice your site, there must be a link to it from another site. following that link will lead to the first crawler save. after indexing your 
website, google will show it in the search results. google has an algorithm that decides how pages are shown. google's results page is referred to as the organic
search results, there are also paid ads. price for the search terms in the ads are determined by level of competition. when determining your page rank, google
relies on the number of links and types of links.
