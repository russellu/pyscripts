weekend _ may 04-06

science:
do presentation for monday

gym:
get back in gym. do more reps with less weight. 3x10 or something

forex:
goal by the end of the weekend is to reproduce matlab strategy in mt4. you have some encouraging results so far, where you are getting somewhat similar results to
what you achieve in matlab, but you are also getting more random looking results.

also, there is the problem that the profit curves don't always reproduce in non-optimized timeperiods. optimize your strategy for robustness 

compare some currencies profit curves directly with the mt4 profit curves. see if you get the same bumps and dips. 
re-run the optimizer on the full datasets, and select parameters for robustness no just max
test deeper parameter sets like on your laptop
