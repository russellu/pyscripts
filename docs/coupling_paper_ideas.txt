coupling_paper_ideas

instead of computing power, comput resting state connectivity across all areas in all subjects? 
check this in a single subject - correlate all gray matter voxels with each other in all states, average the CC. 

source localization + kernel - test coupling using different parameters in a single subject - try beamformer and others (though this
is probably not what results in poor coupling, its probably more the way coupling is computed. in any case, do this on alex's data
and make sure you get the nice rest coupling you had before

possible culprits are the time-frequency method, and the method for computing cross-correlations

1) try to reproduce what you had earlier with the ohbm coupling results. 
2) try different source localization with gamma ersp (beamformer, etc) to see which is most accurate 

coupling idea - functional connectivity as a function of ALFF 

global signal regression - coupling with/without GSR. effects of GSR on NVC 
effects of GSR on NVC differences across region and task - does it become more or less consistent? 


need to blur the FMRI, and don't bandpass filter (do that in matlab).
