goals: you need to know exactly what you want to do when you sit down. don't just start browsing the news meaninglessly. 
sit down. work on project. go back. 
so for tommorrow, that means: #1, get 2 subjects yourself and valerie (tuesday get two more, lyes and someone else). 
first thing: finalize stimulus design, talk to sam, get the electrodes set up, talk to lyes, etc (find others as well). 
stimulus: retinotopic and orientation tuning curves. 1.5s stimulus. jitter between (0.5-1s).
after you have two subjects, go to the gym and do squats etc. 
be at work by 11. get some consent forms off of snail. 
hack sherbrooke - need to look at more datasets. get a better understanding of the project.  
work on the traffic light idea. simple optimizations, and a more complex traffic flow. look at asp.net
game? try to get back to working on the game by doing something simple like loading a map or segmenting a map in matlab
or making sprites of some sort
presentation: implement Kevin's comments, and add some more of your own results (EEG retinotopy among others).
