stuff left to do for phd:
attend 3-4 more conferences, network for a post-doc
publish 2 more papers in high impact journals, and 1 more or more in low impact (giving 5+ total)
	neuroimage/cortex/jneur : coupling
	neuroimage/cortex/jneur : structure
	neuroimage/cortex/jneur/jphys : global gamma orientation tuning 	

do the experiment get 20+ subjects, reveal the structural basis of EEG and EEG-BOLD coupling
by the end of the phd, your goal is to be earning 100$ a day passive income through app store, and have 6 articles publier
20 minutes morning and night from 20 days out, don't be cocky...
pass predoc
	read nunez book, understand electrodynamics
	read buxton book, understand BOLD and MRI physics
	review the gamma literature
	review the EEG-structure literature
	answer the questions posed to you by the examiners 
	GABA receptor density and GABA concentrations - why? 

need to solidify the hypothesis: distance and curvature, but why?

articles:

EEG/GAMMA
1) driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm and controls sensory responses 
2) the origins of extracellular fields and currents - EEG, ECOG, LFP and SPIKES 
3) multiple origins of the cortical gamma rhythm
4) a critical role for NMDA receptors in parvalbumin interneurons for gamma rhythm induction and behavior

BOLD
1) quantification of intravascular and extravascular contribution to BOLD effects induced by alteration in 
oxygenation or intravascular contrast agents
2) ogawa - BOLD
3) diffusion-weighted spin-echo fmri at 9.4T
4) balloon model paper and subsequent papers 

find out why the gradients affect the EEG signal
