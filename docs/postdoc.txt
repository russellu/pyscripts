post-doc ideas 
variational auto-encoders and deep learning, combined with simultaneous EEG-FMRI
deep learning and BCIs

post-doc: you want to do things that will lead to an expansion of your skillset, and likely a professorship sometime in the near future.
something BCI related, something invasive, something outside your field but still close to neuroscience and imaging. 
sleep is also an area of potential interest. maybe something invasive, and sleep-related, or something in animals and sleep related. 
or, just look for a well-regarded lab that does high impact research and try to get some high impact papers, such as the pascal fries lab
gamma and perception for example. 
what would you like to study? sleep, and BCIs, and the thalamus. preferably sleep and the thalamus if possible.

relationship between thalamus and EEG, studied invasively then later set up your lab to study non-invasive 
the effect of RV or HR response across populations? is there a way to measure this without actually measuring the physiological parameters? 
ventricles/CSF? or some other mask. correlate the respiratory response function or the global signal contribution across populations? 
correlate the global signal during resting state and other states, test for significant diffences
or just use a vascular correlation, ie find where the std is highest and correlate that region


pascal fries lab study visual gamma and alpha/beta mua
layer specific FMRI and EEG to investigate frequency specific laminar effects (scheeringa)
