questions for reflection: chapter 1
what keeps you from saving? small purchases, mostly eating out. 15$ per day on average probably. (15*30 = 450$/month). if you stop eating out you can cut that 
in half to 225$/month, and save the 225$/month. also, dumb things like parking tickets and speeding tickets. credit card + unity pro is around 100$/month. 

why is baby step #1 (putting away 1000$) the hardest? because it means a sacrifice in your standard of living, and actually changing stuff in your life. 
why do so many people use debt for emergencies? because they have no savings
how is money amoral/like a brick? it depends on what the person is using it for.
what would constitute a financial emergency for your household? broken car, insurance payments, tax, emergency repair.
