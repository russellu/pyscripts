-make the heart pump to sound and moving the vasculature/rsfmri
	make it pump louder when there are more voxels

-select resting state networks automatically once certain voxels are tagged (do the same for tractography) 
allow users to 'find' tracks and resting state networks, the tracks then light up and are added to a list (same for RSNs)
have some interesting animation that shows the tracks and RSFMRI as a function of time 
animate the ventricles, veins, arteries, etc
