cap rate formula for growth stocks - value = current earnings * (8.5 + 2x expected annual growth rate)

price of a stock (p/e) depends on following:
1) company's 'general long term prospecs'
2) quality of management
3) financial strength and capital structure
	increasing cash from operations over past 10 years -owner earnings per share increase 6-7% for past 10 years
	owner earnings =                   reported earnings (net income from income stmt)
					   + depreciation, amortization (cash flow smt)
					   +/- other on cash charges (cash flow stmt, things like employee stock)
					   - average annual maintenance capex (
					   +/- changes in working capital
	capital structure - long-term debt should be < 50% of total capital
	
4) dividend record
5) current dividend rate

statistical requirements to include company in your portfolio: DEFENSIVE INVESTOR 
1) adequate size - 50-100+ million in annual sales

6) price of stock no more than 1.5x asset value
7) price no more than 15x average earnings of past 3 years

calculate p/e as current price/average earnings of past 3 years

multiply p/e by price to book ratio, should be < 22.5

ENTERPRISING INVESTOR:
1) financial condition: current assets > 1.5x current liabilities, debt < 110% net current assets
2) earnings stability: no deficit in last 5 years
3) dividend record: some current dividends
4) earnings growth: last years earning were greater than those 10 years ago
