INTRODUCTION
earth's rotation, and new technology (changing light regimes) 	
important things to mention: LEDs (light spectrum), lag effects, sphere of influence, evolutionary novelty, sensitivity/diversity of bio responses, impact on 
human health - start with a BROAD intro/overview of light pollution

anatomy and physiology of circadian system - slow rhythmic modulations in bodily processes and behavior, chronobiology, ultradian, circadian, infradian
SCN - central oscillator, gene regulation, basic connections & peripheral oscillators, RHT rat lesion study
how light affects the circadian system - rods, cones, and ipRGCs (melanopsin) (1998), blue light (480nm), 
functions under control of SCN - locomotion, heart rate, body temperature, sleep, corticosteroid system, MELATONIN SECRETION (most reliable measure) 
	(marker rhythms) 
entrainment of circadian (photo-entrainment), threshold/saturation, logarithmic rise, nonphotic zeitgebers
light in morning vs evening, phase advance vs retreat
old mice subjected to temporal disruptions equivalent to a flight from Washington to Paris, once a week for 8 weeks, died prematurely

ALAN, melatonin secretion, sleep deprivation, internal clock - health impacts and mechanisms
does not affect the body in the form of direct toxicity or physical energy, as chemical toxicants/radiation do
shift work effects - cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, mood disorder, obesity, age-related macular degeneration, less/lower quality sleep, lower melatonin
	regular work is now rare (25%) 
IARC - group 2a probably carcinogen
	breast cancer and ALAN (israel/south korea), prospective studies in usa and uk, strong evidence of ALAN breast cancer link
mechanisms - inhibition of nighttime melatonin secretion, sleep deprivation, chronodisruption. 
	animal models where melatonin affects tumor growth, melatonin levels and estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, anti-estrogenic activity
	BL induced melatonin suppression was also much higher in subjects diagnosed with pre-menstrual dysmorphic disorder
