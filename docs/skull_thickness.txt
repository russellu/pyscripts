skull thickness

resources: 
guillaume, maxime, brainstorm, freesurfer

get the average skull thickness using a T1. 

step 1: isolate the electrode
step 2: create a sphere around the electrode
step 3: correlate the cylinder passing into the brain with EEG power in each voxel
	(slice-wise comparison)...can do the same over V1 ROI as center of mass ROI) 

step 1: get surface layers in head below electrode
step 2: align and average (align along normal to head COM)

scalp layers rather than cortical layers determine inter-subject human eeg variability	

a simpler thing to check is average distance from electrode to gray matter voxel in each subject 
you can also examine posterior scalp anatomy by averaging tissue under electrodes in the occipital lobe 

break distance up into two metrics - brain surface-ROI distance, or electrode-brain surface distance

use the gray matter mask, and draw vectors between electrodes to gray matter, and gray matter to ROI. 

you can then define these two different distance metrics as 
electrode to brain surface 
brain surface to activation

correlate those two separately with gamma 

electrode to brain, and brain to ROI center
voxel-wise curvature metrics and Robson ROI
read reviews again and look for anything else, re-submit to neuroimage 

first result - correlate distance between all scalp - cortex values with ERSP. \
second result - brain-roi distance vs ersp .

break up distance into two metrics:
1) scalp-brain distance (average across electrodes, proxy for skull thickness). 
2) scalp-ROI distance 

average the scalp-brain distance across all electrodes, which is a proxy for skull thickness 

then get the voxel-specific curvature metrics and re-write/add a few figures and results if you can 
show distance in permuted electrode coordinates, or mention in methods to ensure no specific electrode was driving correlation
(or show correlations across all electrodes to further avert this objection)
