some resolutions for the foreseeable future:
no more laughing after everything you say
no more rapport seeking tonality in conversations with other guys or womens, regradless of their status or your status
no more looking at breitbart, foxnews, cnn, or bodybuilding forums BULLSHIT...keep that out of your mind fucking pointless bullshit
