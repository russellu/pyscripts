list of figures: 

fmri ROI
EEG gamma topoplot
22 subjects ersp + topoplots + ROI (suppl.)
stimuli (gray image)
average stimuli ersp 
average subjects/stimuli ersp (show box around gamma), grand average topoplot
grand average FMRI ROI overlayed on average EPI 
2 subjects (strong and weak responder) with ERSP, topoplot, and average ROI 
show ERSP or show mean freqs?

scatter plot distance vs gamma
scatter plot i0 vs gamma
scatter plot intrinsic/extrinsic/gaussian/foldind vs gamma
topoplot distance vs gamma (corr) at each electrode
topoplot slope at each electrode
scatter plot slope vs distance all electrodes (slope of scatter plot)
scatter plot power vs distance all electrodes (inverse-squared)

need to show the plots from where you actually get the data. ie, the raw gamma plots. then re-do the correlations using those
raw gamma plots, so the entire paper can be coherent.
