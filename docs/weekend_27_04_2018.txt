goals: weekend of the 27-28-29

goal #1: get the online shop working with downloadable products - by sunday night, you want to be running an advertising campaign selling your trading software
with landing page pitch, and a way to track clicks (which ads convert best)
	starting point: finish the free downloadable pdf
	pdf - re-read once more, finish with links, and a convincing pitch, and convert to pdf. upload to site, and write landing page. 
	get the optimal parameters for all strategies, and the maximum pip differences for all indicator types. make sure you pitch this hard. 
		have this pdf done before lunch'
	
	how are you going to arrange the parameters? just a long-ass list in pdf format? matrices? 
	excel table with the following fields: average profit/loss, number of trades, profit curve correlation, etc. save by currency and timeframe, but also save
	a gigantic table with all the SORTED parameters. 
		go buy currency, each currency has its own directory, and you run all the strategies on that currency. 
		save only the best parameters for each currency, (based on objective market data) then build the strategy from there. 	
	the pitch is good, but now you need to condense it down into 1/4 the text, and go heavier on marketing
		ie, you need to create fear of missing out in people, and make them believe you have the answer to all their problems. its way too long as is.



goal #2: finish SFN abstract, and analyze all your currently available data. start seriously thinking about the paper you want to write for this. 
	starting point: check the abstract format on the SFN website
