coupling paper final version

main findings: 
1) motion contributes to gamma-bold correlations
2) residual ballistocardiogram contributes to alpha-bold correlations
	1&2 => global signal regression reduces artifactual NVC
3) global signal regression decreases variability across states 
4) narrow band gamma power vs broadband gamma changes - show specific ERSP vs noise spectrogram

title: global signal regression attenuates spurious EEG-BOLD correlations

abstract: obtaining neurophysiological and hemodynamic measures simultaneously is a powerful method


results:

data needed:
1) source-localized bandpass filtered EEG power in each voxel
2) source-localized bandpass filtered BCG power in each voxel
3) BOLD global signal, BOLD motion parameters, BOLD time series (pre and post GSR, use 3dTproject to filter out both at once) 

from this, you can get the following:
1) source-space frequency specific EEG-BOLD correlations in all states
2) source-space frequency specific bcg-BOLD correlations in all states
3) quantify the motion - use motion parameters xcorr with BOLD?
	motion param xcorr with MELODIC output?
