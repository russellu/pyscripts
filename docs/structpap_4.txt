amplitude vs SNR - divide by baseline to get SNR, subtract for difference. should give similar results? 

first figure has to be a topoplot vs a fmri ROI overlay 

gamma snr is so much lower than alpha/beta, and is near the snr detection threshold. 

check the inverse-squared alpha (As a function of electrode) 

build the entire figure in matlab - don't move it around much in illustrator

try to have figures 1,2,3 done by tonight. 

todo: add in peak frequency to the distance plot, make the curvature plot, and re-write the text.  should be good to go by the end of monday. 

inot vs #voxels vs alpha/beta/gamma amplitude

goal: have 3 more papers published by the time you apply for grant money (5 first author papers, 3 in high impact journals) 

figure 4 - inot - alpha/beta appears to be more related to i0 than gamma, though still not significant. 
is there a way to show that alpha is more spatially distributed than gamma? check the significant differences across trials for alpha/beta and
gamma, see how many electrodes are significantly activated for alpha/beta and gamma

figure 5 - need this to be a strong concluding figure, not just some mash-up of previous results.
candidates: peak frequency (no need can just put them in the results), distance vs curvature, effects of distance and curvature on gamma 
amplitude (combined). 

1a correlate distance with i0.
1b examine the combined effects of distance and I0.
