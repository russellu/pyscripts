one purchase with 100 downloads. 
lets say you can get 5% conversion on your in-app purchases (which is average)
you're getting roughly 200 downloads in teh first month, so maybe 500 on average when it peaks
so, at best you'll be getting 25 buys a month, or around 125$ a month, which is decent. if you can do the same with your next app,
that'll be 250-300$ a month (hopefully more), and you'll be well on your way to paying your living expenses with apps alone.
