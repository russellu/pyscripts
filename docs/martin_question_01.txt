describe dynamic contrast enhanced DCEMRI and how it can be used to assess BBB in human participants:
part 1: DCE MRI sequence
assessing leakage of a contrast agent following injection
dynamic imaging during the passage of a peripherally injected bolus of a paramagnetic contrast agent, using a T1
weighted MR sequence. 
saturation recovery gradient recalled sequence both for initial T1 measurement and subsequent dynamic imaging
each slice was acquired after application of a nonselective saturation prepulse with a saturation time delay.
echoes were read with a radiofrequency flip angle of 30deg, pulse repeition time of 3.82ms, echo time of 1.9ms, 
centric phase ordering, scan matrix size 96x61, SENSE factor 2, 240x182mm, and four slices of 8mm thickness
the T1 measurement was performed by varying the TD value, (120,150,300,600,1000,2000,4000,8000,9000,10000). 
the passage of the contrast bolus was imaged using a TD of 120ms, low TD has been previously shown to minimize the
effect of water exchange in such measurements. the most caudal slice was placed orthogonal to the internal carotid,
based on an MR angiography, in order to obtain an arterial input function, with minimal PVE. in total, 180 frames
with a time resolution of 1s were obtained. the automatic bolus injection was started after the 10th frame, the 
dose of contrast agent was 0.05mmol/kg, the magnitude of the dose based on a compromise between increasing the CNR
for a higher dose, and the possibility of inducing a T2* effect or truncation of the bolus peak of the arterial 
input function. 
the MR signal is not linear in contrast agent concentration, but the change of R1 is proportional to the contrast
agent concentration with regard to both blood and tissue. when using centric phase ordering, the MR signal s(t) as
a function of time t and deltaR1(t) and concentration C(t) are related by 
s(t) = M0*sin(alpha)*[1-exp(-TD(R1+deltaR1(t)))], deltaR1(t) = r1*C(t), the relaxivity r1 of Gd-DTPA at 3T was set 
to 4/sec*mM, equal relaxivities were assumed for the intravascular compartment and the tissue in general.
