an arcade style hack n slash - short levels (And chained levels) with a map/armory stage and a main menu/character selection screen

the map editor - how are you gonna make the levels? you should create a palate editor in matlab, to 

get a higher resolution camera - 10000x10000 pixels should make for some nice big levels. your character is around 50x50 pixels,
so if the level is 10000x10000, that means
the screen surrounding the character should be around 10x the size, so 500x500 pixels, which means around 20 screen shifts up and
down etc. thats about the size of a normal baldur's gate level, should be enough.
