cellular mechanisms of the blood brain barrier opening induced by ultrasound in the presence of microbubbles
abstract: local BBB opening is an advantageous approach for targeting drug delivery to the brain. recently, it has been 
shown that focused ultrasound (US) sonications, when applied in the presence of preformed gas bubbles, caused magnetic
resonance proven reversible opening of the BBB in target locations, however the cellular mechanisms of such transient 
disruption are largely unknown. we investigated US induced changes in endothelial cell fine morphology that resulted in 
BBB opening in rabbits. to obtain evidence for the passage of blood-borne macromolecules through the opened transvascular
routes, an immunocytochemical procedure for endogenous immunoglobinG was performed, in addition to routine electron 
microscopy. an increased number of vessels and vacuoles, fenestration and channel formation, as well as opening of some
tight junctions were seen in capillaries after low-powered sonication. immunosignals presented in some of the vesicles 
and vacuoles, in the cytoplasmic channels, and so rarely in the intracellular clefts; immunosignals could also be seen in
neuropil around the blood vessels. damage to the cellular ultrastructure was not seen in those areas. however, cell 
destruction and leakage of IgC through defects of the endothelial cell lining took place at 3W sonications. the data 
reveals that several mechanisms of transcapillary passage are possible after such sonications: 1) transcytosis, 
2) endothelial cell cytoplasmic openings -fenestration and channel formation 3) opening of a part of tight junction
and 4) free passage through the injured endothelium (with higher power sonications).
