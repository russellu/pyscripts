question from jf
gamma frequencies and mechanisms of gabaergic inhibition 
recent studies have shown an important divergence in measuring gabergic mechanisms with MRS and with TMS. 
considering that the EEG gamma band is also presumed to be associated to inhibitory gabaergic mechanisms,
1) what is the relationship between the gamma frequency band and markers of gabaergic processes in the human?
2) what pattern of gamma responses can be expected in populations with decreased gabaergic processes including
fragile x-syndrome or autism?
