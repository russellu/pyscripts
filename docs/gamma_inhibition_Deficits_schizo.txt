evidence for gamma inhibition deficits in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia: 
abstract: previous studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have deficits in cortical inhibition.
through the combination of tms and eeg, it has been shown that cortical inhibition can be measured over the dlpfc, a region closely 
associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. it is possible to index cortical inhibition of specific frequency bands, including
the gamma band whose modulation has been related to higher order cortical processing. this study shows that patients with schizophrenia
have significant deficits of cortical inhibition of gamma oscillations in the dlpf, compared to healthy subjects or subjects with 
bipolar disorder, while no deficits are demonstrated in the motor cortex. the results suggest that lack of inhibition of gamma 
oscillations in the dlpf represent an important frontal neurophysiological deficit, which may be responsible for the spectrum of deficits
commonly found in schizophrenia. 

introduction: several lines of evidence suggest that CI is impaired in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. it has been shown
that patients with schizophrenia have deficits in gamma oscillatory activity in response to auditory tones, or during perception of a 
gestalt, while other studies have shown impairment in gamma modulation in the dlpfc during working memory tasks. both an increase and
reduction of gamma oscillations have been reported in schizophrenia, and these studies suggest that gabaa receptor mediated inhibitory
post-synaptic potentials contribute to generation of gamma oscillations.
