creating the recycler view: (can copy code directly)
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview

add composite views to the recycler view (ie, two textviews + an image, etc.)
https://medium.com/@droidbyme/android-recyclerview-with-multiple-view-type-multiple-view-holder-af798458763b
actually, the main point of that tutorial is to show how to have multiple different view types within one recyclerview,
but it also shows how to customize your single view type (if you want your list of emails to display both subject and author or date, etc.)

adding a touch listener to your recyclerview list: (handles long press as well, to delete)
