today: january 23 2019

current trends: phd research seminar, phd thesis, fibernavigator app, linked in networking/job search

research seminar:
methods (6 slides)
EEG underlying physics for how signal on scalp is measured (2 slides)
	emphasize how distance and orientation play a role
	emphasize how difficult it is to interpret scalp measurements
FMRI underlying physics for how BOLD signal is observed (2 slides)
	emphasize the spatial resolution
MRI underlying physics for how T1 signal is observed (2 slides)
	emphasize gray/white matter boundary
	talk about BET, skull segmentation
UTE MRI underlying physics for how UTE is observed 

phd thesis - same as the above, but more detail (20 pages)

fibernavigator app
	-quads (done) 
	-speed up correlation with higher resolution		
		(how?) 
		check where its slowest, try to optimize those parts

linkedin: talk to andrew, and other people from vancouver/ottawa
