elon musk does not read books on time management, he just works
you know instinctively what you need to do. 
tackle the largest and most important tasks in the morning, when you are still fresh, and don't let up until you have completed your objective.
later in the day, you can start to take breaks, and relax a bit. 
but when you start off, you shouldn't be doing any procrastination, because your mind is fresh in the morning. don't waste this time

you have realistically another 25 years of prime productivity.

25*365*5 = 45,625 hours left in your life of prime, productive work. every hour you waste detracts from your future earning potential,
the legacy you will leave behind to your descendents, and the overall well-being of humanity. the stakes could not be higher, so while it 
may seem like a trivial matter to open up a youtube tab and watch some entertaning video, you are actually just wasting time that would be
better spent elsewhere.
