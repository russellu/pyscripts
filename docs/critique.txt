slide #8 - number of subjects in (2)
slide #9 - less variability? need to show this, or tone it down. 
slide #10 - mono vs di, explain the difference 
slide #11 - quality of figure is bad
slide #16 - remove 
slide #17 - dipole in sphere, often assumed that this governs EEG (don't just look to confirm the equation)
slide #19 - 1/r^2, plot in matlab, mention cutoff, add n=7, and introduce 3 measures	
slide #21 - get ref
slide #22 - show scalp topography, 2 channels, right/left, top/bottom
show BOLD retinotopic maps with the stimulus design (earlier) 
slide #35 - EEG retinotopic mapping paper #1
	  - find dataset
	  - existing dataset: simulate a clinical population 
noise floor, jumps in impedence
add no systematic difference peak frequency power at the end of lit review
