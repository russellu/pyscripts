pay per call blueprint

getting in with local businesses 
traffic sources - don't lose your focus, pay per call leverages specific traffic sources
focus on the traffic sources that work best for ppc (call only campaigns, traditional search with landing page)
difference between no landing and landing page, google incentivises through ad extensions
landing pages lead to cheaper traffic with more volume, higher click through rates
google adwords is the low hanging fruit of traffic sources

what makes a good affiliate? the ability to drive consistent, high volume traffic

campaigns are more complicated than you think - eating disorder example, parents, catch-22

application and agreement to terms - website + traffic method

put yourself in the eyes of the person searching for the product
get cheap traffic relevant to what you're looking for

red flag - only one competitor running a call extension, no click to call campaigns (for a keyword phrase)

spyfu - spy on your competitors, get their keywords and find the ones that would convert well to click to call

make small, iterative changes
