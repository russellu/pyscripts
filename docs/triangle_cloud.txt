how to register the FMRI points with the anatomy?
first, just try to create the triangle cloud in the same space as the brain.
then you can handle scaling issues etc with the real FMRI 

today: finish the RSFC, and functional connectivity object, then the app will be pretty much complete and you can go back 
to writing the biorxviv paper

functional connectivity:
1) make the sphere and get it so the sphere can select voxels
	use the same mask on all images
	test correlation speed	
	get indices for all FMRI x,y,z voxels
	activate the indices based on a selection box 

		get the brain with 10 points of highest variance, use those to drive correlation (if other method is too slow)
			test the correlation speed first
	to do the correlation:
	1) create a new vector 

	the next step (and the hardest probably) - display only the voxels within the selection object 
		once this is done, the rest is easy 
	the FMIR Point octree requires the voxel index (in the voxel tree) and the mesh index 	
	need to compartmentalize the voxel vertices into an index list
	the octree is populated by the center index of each voxel. 
	an underlying array links the center index of each voxel to the vertex indices in the mesh 
	the voxel vertice indices - need to know which mesh, and which voxel

	done - now time for the correlation. 

2) average correlations within the sphere, and set voxels accordingly 

set loading message, and load only when user clicks 	

cleaning up the correlation map
increasing speed: show gray matter voxels only (try to get it under 5k voxels) 
increasing speed: use a faster correlation metric
improving visualization - make it opaque, increase size of the quads 
can speed up the correlation by using pre-defining all the important sums
reduce the 
remove the RSFMRI (too slow for app, doesn't add much value) 
remove resting state functional connectivity
remove white matter voxels
reduce number of time points 
funcitonal connectivity only button 

bugs: 
a few voxels outside the selection sphere remain active (nans?)
fixed
need to improve the rendering speed, instead of setting it to translucent, change the vertex position?
