my fitness workout planner is a flexible journal for recording workouts and visualizing workout results 
it allows you to create customized workouts (by creating a new session), and within each session, you can add your own exercises.
it allows you to track your progress and visualize your results across sessions and exercises, and notifies you when you reach a new personal best


there are three basic types of exercise:
1) SIMPLE ACTIVITY
	the simple activity is used to describe exercises/activities with only one number per entry.
	an example of a simple activity would be "number of pushups" which is one number per entry

2) MULTI-SET ACTIVITY
	the multi-set activity is used to describe exercises/activities with more than one number per entry
	an example of a multi-set activity would be a 3x8 set of bench press (135 pounds, 8 reps, 3 sets)

3) TIMED activity
	the timed activity is used to describe exercises/activities that require a timer
	an example of a timed activity would be the time spent in the plank position (an ab exercise)

the planner can also be used for tracking more unconventional metrics (it doesn't have to be used for exercises only)
	for example, the timer could be used to track your commute to/from work each day
		     the simple activity could be used to record the number of calories and your weight each day
