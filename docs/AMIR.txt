amir questions:

possibility of using optogenetics with BOLD or other FMRI/PET 
possibility of using simultaneous neurophysiology FMRI (high resolution FMRI)

possible papers: 

optogenetic control of orientation tuning 
global gamma vs local gamma/LFP and BOLD (using orientation tuning)
effects of optogenetics on global and local gamma

if possible - effects on alpha/beta and gamma rhythms, and these rhythms' relationship to BOLD

what is a major problem in currentyl neuroscience
the neurophysiological origins of the human EEG gamma rhythm - why does it respond the way it does,
and what neurophysiological underpinnings cause it to be that way
more specifically: why does it prefer oblique over cardinal gratings, why the temporo-spatial
frequency tuning (of scalp gammma), why the sensitivity to randomization

use human and mice/marmosets, measure LFP, EEG, and control using optogenetics. possibly combine
with hemodynamic measures such as FMRI as well. relate differences in human gamma EEG to differences
in neural activity. 
double peak - where does it come from, how does it arise? 

using optogenetics in the thalamus to alter cortical rhythms and investigate lower frequencies 

neurophsiological origins of global gamma and link it to EEG
tuning (spatial/temporal frequency, orientation, randomization, etc) 
spectral patterns (Desynch, double peak, peak frequency)
relationship to neurophysiology and FMRI 
neurovascular coupling during resting state and during stimulation
