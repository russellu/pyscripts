what to say when you talk to yourself
1) programming creates beliefs
2) beliefs create attitudes
3) attitudes create feelings
4) feelings determine actions
5) actions create results

self talk is a way to override your past negative programming, by erasing or replacing it
with conscious, positive new directions. 

level 1 self talk: defeatist, negative ie "i can't" 

level 2 self talk: more defeatist, negative disguised as positive "i should"

level 3 sefl talk: works for you, positive: "i never, i no longer, etc"

level 4 self talk: works for you, paint picture of how you want to be "i am"

level 5 self talk: universal truth affirmations "it is"

it is not enough to remove negative thoughts, you need to replace that with positive thought
