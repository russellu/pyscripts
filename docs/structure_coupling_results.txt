todo: 

coupling paper: get all subjects aligned in their folders, including karl and sukhman
	-> work on gradient denoising
	-> work on bcg denoising, and motion correction denoising
	
for each subject, you need the following: freesurfer, electrode coordinates, registered gray matter, ica decompositions, grid, denoised EEG (grad+bcg+ica)


structure_timeline:
today : 
	denoise all FMRI, get ROIs for all subjects (9 subj + 24 subj) 




gradient denoising: the best way is to fit each artifact using other artifacts, to minimize the distance between each artifact and the average
maybe instead of regressing, select the artifacts so that the ssd is equal to zero, when you add them all up..
ie, artifact x - artifact y  = -1, artifact

for each artifact, select only the artifacts in the immediate vicinity, and then apply a weighting factor to each of them ,so that they approximate as closely 
as possible the artifact you are trying to model 

recursive ICA - perform ICA on the raw dataset, then subtract the clean dataset from the raw, and run ICA on that noise image, as well as on the "clean" data set.

by tonight: get the bandpass filtered ROIs for the gamma stimuli + all subject's ERSP (gamma power in occipital electrodes). 
tomorrow - compute correlations between IO and gamma power, and distance/gamma power. 

to compute final results you need the following: 1) electrode locations 2) surface normals 3) electrode space gamma power modulation 4) FMRI hot activation mask

the message: functional vs structural measures, %change and extent of activation, stimulus types correlated across subjects (structure),
