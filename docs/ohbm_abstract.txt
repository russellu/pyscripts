motion and heartbeat artifacts account for gamma-bold and alpha-bold coupling in EEG-FMRI

motion and cardiac artifacts explain the majority of simultaneous EEG-FMRI coupling in alpha and gamma bands

results: 
first, show the typical alpha-bold correlation response at canonical HRF, which is stronger in posterior lobe
then, show gamma-bold coupling before motion

then show the effects of global signal regression/heartbeat removal
	before/after GSR (voxel-wise, and average across whole brain)
	alpha voxels - correlations before/after GSR, and t-values.
then show the effects of motion removal on gamma-bold
	before/after motion removal (voxel-wise, and average across whole brain)
	gamma voxels - correlationns before/after GSR, and t-values

alpha hrf - compare it to the cardiac response function from Chang et al
gamma hrf - compare it to breathing response function? 

conclude

motion time course - bold vs spectrogram vs motion

need a figure illustrating global signal regression, and alpha/beta power time courses before/after GSR. 
use alex's brain (strong global signal, and strong alpha/beta responses - denoise in bvrecorder (rest only)

problem with interpretation - the reduced whole-brain coupling due to GSR may be due simply to increased positive
coupling which centers the correlations around zero. you should instead look at the squared coupling, to see
if anything changes from pre to post GSR. 

GSR increases similarity of EEG-BOLD coupling with canonical HRF

denoise gradient in matlab, and get the mean heart rate channel for each subject, cross correlate with denoised data 
	show that the BCG correlates with the source-localized EEG in a similar fashion to the global signal

the final piece of the puzzle - show that the BCG correlates with global signal and other EEG channels (if you can). 

the relationship between global signal and BCG and source-localized EEG
BCG and global signal - positive 0s, negative alpha 6s
channel-level data vs BCG - correlation of all channel-level signals with BCG - what does this show?
then, look at BCG ica vs global (Average across subjects)
then look at bcg vs EEG sources. 

results: gamma reduced by motion correction, alpha reduced by GSR and more closely matches hrf, GS correlates with bcg,
bcg correlates with EEG, most of EEG coupling is due to cardiac artifact (reduced by GSR) 

correlate BCG or just stop here? 
correlate BCG with denoised scalp-level data, show this result as EEG vs EEG bcg (last result) 
correate BCG with denoised scalp-level data, and correlate BCG with global signal
bcg vs denoised eeg -> relationship of bcg to EEG
bcg vs gs -> relationship of bcg to GS 
(both interesting)
