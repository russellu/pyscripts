overall goal: 

find out if neurovascular coupling changes as a function of sleep stage
find a general relationship between NVC and EEG/BOLD power spectrum 

today: get source-localized EEG signals and align them with FMRI 

0) remove bcg & gradient artifacts
1) compute ICA
2) denoise channels
3) compute sources
4) 

OR

0) remove bcg & gradient
1) compute ICA, denoise channels
2) filter
3) down-sample & convolve
4) correlate with BOLD
