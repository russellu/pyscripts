the GOAT equation

greatness = (win ratio) * (average competition quality) * weight
where average competition quality = mean(win ratio of competition at time of fight)
      win ratio = #wins / (#real losses + 1), real losses = losses not by DQ or freak injury/cut
      weight = weight class, if heavyweight, then mean weight of opponents 

other scaling factors:
clean GOAT (eliminate PED users)
prime GOAT (22-35)
p4p GOAT (eliminate weight factor)
