first - make script that does all the analysis in one script, one for the small group, and one for the large group.
	save this script and the output figures, so you can go back to it to update figures during writing

figure 1
	EEG gamma responses - variability across subjects, and stimuli, strong, medium, and weak responders (to 3 stimuli) 
		show single trial gamma response time series, etc 
	show topoplots to show individual topography, maybe mask out electrodes with no significant gamma response? 
	FMRI BOLD responses - correlation maps (strong, medium, and weak correlation maps, show electrodes with distance, and I0)
	show electrode coordinate images 
	
figure 2
	group 1 and group 2, all electrodes errorbarxy vs gamma power at each electrode - show inverse-square law, but show also
	that within the posterior electrodes, there is variability as in, deviation from the inverse-squared law (ie, zoom in on post.)
	high/medium/non-responders - can also cluster your subjects using k-means, to distinguish between medium/low responders
	this will give an additional effect - pretty much the same as a correlation, but a different way of showing it. 

figure 3
	fibernav image of electrode vs center of mass of V1 ROI, and another way to visualize I0
		ANOTHER type of correlation - closest 50-100 normals to each electrode, cancellation? 
	group correlation for group 1 and group 2 - scatter plots of mean distance vs 
	THIS is the main result of the paper - two groups, same pattern of correlation in both groups, similar magnitude correlations,
	around 50% of inter-subject variability explained by distance and curvature combined
	maybe show two fiber-nav images, highest and weakest responder, with distance from electrode to brain. 

figure 4 - modeling? combining distance and curvature to better predict inter-subject EEG gamma power variability
	gamma power = b + distance*x + curvature*y - see if you can show that distance and curvature contribute independently
	also, do a simple simulation showing that event-related power can be affected by distance, due to cancellation from random
	fields (Random field cancellation effect)
