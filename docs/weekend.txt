weekend:
finalize and practice seminar 
analyze all the BOLD/ASL data (2-subjects, HAIFA and ANNE-MARIE) 
-> get BOLD %change and ASL %change, see if you can denoise the ASL in a manner similar to BOLD (using ICA) 
look more at the BOLD - see if you can register to gray matter - by cutting off the end of the brain?

is there another way to regress out signal without modeling it exactly? you could get the peak echo time perhaps in a 
multi-echo sequence, and use that to map the large veins. 
you also need to know how much the veins are going to spread. if you don't smooth, the signal shouldn't spread but the
dephasing may be greater than the voxel size. 

v1 surface area slightly higher on one side = higher peak gamma frequency? what about right,left etc? what about total 
size?? also, compare the amount of activation to any one quadrant to the amount of vasculature in that quadrant. 

ake sure you put the gel on the back of the head. 

tracking microvasculature draining into macrovasculature?
0.75,0.75,1.5 => 3.5s TR. will have to do very long blocks (30sec each?) will also lose signal. but with enough trials,
should be ok. 
mix up the discrete/continuous => 30 seconds per angle => 120 angles max. wow. you could probably get away with 20 at a TR
or 3.5, (20/3.5 = ~6) so 6 volumes per stimulus configuration, 20 seconds of EEG data, 180 different stimulus configs,
throw out any that are bad. estimate PRF on these? the continuous dragging is too slow for the TR, unless you do it 
extremely slowly, like 1 cycle per 2 minutes. if you can do 15-20 cycles though, that gives you a lot of trials, and
you can smooth across cycles. so if you have 120/3.7 = 32.43, but it won't be exactly the same for each angle, ie the
BOLD TR offset will be different (you can track it in the EEG data also). 

try 2 minute blocks tomorrow (continuous), see how that works. try quadrants, and octants, and hemis.
