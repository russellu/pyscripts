business_goals
by the time you go to cuba (october 21), ~2 months, you want to have accomplished the following:

app:
release the second app, with auto-trader and data downloads, and indicators. add in some strategies
that work for you, and let the user customize the auto-trader parameters. 
also, let the user customize their own signals - ie, they can auto-generate trading signals and act on them. 

blog:
20+ quality blog posts. once you get to 10-15 posts, start trolling websites for views
you want 30k visitors a month, like they say in WSPB, to get there will require serious work however

strategy:
up and running demo accounts on both mql4/5, and jforex. find out how to obfuscate strategy or ensure that the private key works
for it to run. 
by the end of the week - have a profitable strategy up and running in dukascopy, at least (on the work cpu).
