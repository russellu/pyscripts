next publications: 3 more articles + IMEKA by the time you graduate from usherbrooke

1) distance vs gamma
2) orientation/retinotopic tuning of gamma, alpha/beta, and BOLD
3) coupling + dynamic coupling 
4) IMEKA app free to download on app store and play store

re-submit the neuroimage article once kevin has finished looking it over
get final subjects for FMRI and EEG retinotopy/orientation tuning, need around 5 more 
EEG and 1-2 more FMRI. 

get the stimulus parameters from the downstairs computer and re-program every 
crowd-source for deep learning applications - cortical segmentations, and med student 
learning.
