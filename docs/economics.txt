economics textbook: 

only write down things that will help you make trading decisions based on fundamental analysis 

the basic economic problem: how to satisfy infinite desires with limited resources?

four factors of production:
1) land
2) labor
3) capital
4) enterprise

the concept of margin: ice cream example: the marginal cost of an ice cream is the additional cost of making one additional ice cream
can be found by finding the difference in total cost at the new output level from the total cost at one unit less than that 
a lot of economic theory is based on the assumption that people make decisions based on marginal changes 

markets are where goods and services are bought and sold

demand is the quantity of a good/service that consumers are willing to buy at a given time for a certain price
movement along the demand curve is caused by changes in price
competitive demand: increase in the price of one good increases demand for a competing good
complementary goods are those whose demand increases together (ie strawberries and cream)
there is also composite and derived demand

price elasticity of demand is a measure of how the quantity of a demanded good reacts to changes in price of the good
there is PED, YED, and XED (price elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, and cross elasticity of demand). 

PED = percentage change in quantity demanded / percentage change in price 
if a good has elastic demand, raising its price will reduce revenue
