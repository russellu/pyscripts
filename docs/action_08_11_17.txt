main priorities - understand all the math behind the techniques in the weka data mining book. 
including: multiple integrals, partial derivatives, probability distributions, bayesian inference
1) first two chapters of bishop, all problems/EASY PROBLEMS (1*)
	+ any supporting math from calculus/probability/linear algebra txtbooks 
2) release game on steam (needs revisions) (done)
3) monetize ios version of game (done) 
	if this still doesn't work, try to do it without the codeless iap buttons. 
4) add opengl to website, add movie trailer to website
5) complete rough version of website for all app versions (4) 
6) integrate the gaussian distribution (done)
7) email layachi/ayoub about cs 405 (python, overlap with statistical learning, etc) (done)
8) more integrals at the library - spend 2 hrs per day 'working out' your brain doing integrals at the library. 
	double/triple integrals, partial derivatives, integration by parts/substitution/trig/etc
9) linear algebra - be able to solve least squares with matrices, and understand the math
	-stay 'in the pocket' when it comes to learning math, ie constantly battling new ideas

morning - bishop's ML problems or theory (calculus etc). afteroon linear algebra.
start re-reading and building up slides next week, start finalizing android slides as well 

this weekend: start re-read of weka, make sure you understand all the math, start adding slides.
review: probability theory (random variables, conditional probability, etc)
review: linear algebra matrix identities, qr factorization, linear regression
review: calculus multiple integrals, partial derivatives

class starts wednesday september 4th ... it begins
