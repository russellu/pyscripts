lets say you pick the addiction treatment campaign - how can you sell this? you want to recruit people who are calling looking for addiction treatment,
typically the person themselves, or a loved one. people either search for addiction
a simple strategy - find the area with the highest concentration of keywords search, and target there
download all the terms, and find when you want to do the max spending based on season, geography, etc (3d heatmaps). then just maximize your spending around those
times.
