goal: compare physiological recording with mass-application technology to gain additional information from limited recording device.

main result:

BRAIN ACTIVITY vs MASS MONITORING SIGNALS in simple random sample of healthy humans (age range 18-24) 

EEG components/source localization (BRAIN ACTIVITY)
	EEG power spectrum (brain activity) 
		task-induced (record during task for performance)
			gamma wave amplitude/peak frequency
		baseline (resting state)
			alpha wave shape/amplitude/peak

Apple watch pulse oximeter
	heart rate variability (HRV)
		sleep
		wake curve
		RSA

why? RSA, HRV linked to a variety of neurophsychological conditions, but brain activity not known (exists on spectrum)
	also, brain signals may be more dependent on basic physiology than we realize (like BOLD FMRI) 

performance vs apple watch (and relationship to brain waves)
needs task

an example of two metrics you will compare? RSA amplitude vs alpha peak frequency, or heart rate vs peak frequency
simple random sampling - without replacement, and follow another group more long-term, but perform same recording in all
300 SRS subjects, 30 subjects followed weekly 

<30 minute experiment from sit-down to get up. just name the recording and go. assembly line type shit. 
offer 10$ recordings - get high variance subjects - use them for subsequent apple watch/MRI study 

voluntary and involuntary eye movements task experiment
autonomic nervous system recording metrics?
